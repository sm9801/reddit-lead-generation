xyb2i3,Imaginary_Athlete_56,exjw,So I think people need to think more deeply about all of the bad things that are‚Ä¶,"happening in the world. When Satan gave God the middle finger and deceived Eve we were all put under the curse. 

Yes people there are consequences for actions. 

And no one was in the dark. God made sure everyone knew the rules. 

So yes, things are tough!! People get sick, pets get cancer, children die, it‚Äôs a violent world and people are experiencing war and starvation. This is terrible and I am personally touched by all of this awfulness. 

I see people writing, well God shouldn‚Äôt have let this happen if he is perfect and all knowing. 

Hang on. He gave ALL his creation free will. This includes Satan and his followers. 

Satan is where your anger should be directed. He is the one who creates all of this pain and misery and is because of his selfishness and desire for what can never be his that we are in this dark place. 

All of US were also given free will. We can decide whether we understand what‚Äôs going on and serve God or choose not to - that is a privilege. That is a loving God. No one is forced to do anything!

And he has established a finely balanced legal response to our situation in the form of Jesus and his sacrificial death.  That is also a very loving thing. Would you give your son or daughter to save the people in your local community? Nail then to a cross? üßê 

If you don‚Äôt believe in God, great, your choice. You can no longer whinge about Him being responsible for all the bad. 

If you do worship him, then you understand your disgust is directed at Satan.

For those do believe; Gods way of thinking is far above ours. He knows the right time to move and start cleaning things up! Our job is to persevere, endure and despite everything worship God. We must trust Him. 

There will be a new heavens and new Earth. There will be a cleansing. Let‚Äôs just keep that in mind as we work through this pretty upsetting environment we are all living in.

This is why it was weird to me:

1. He has been dead for over a decade.
2. I don't even recall thinking about him in years.
3. I never thought he was influential and always thought he was annoying and overly prideful.
4. I never have vivid dreams.

Are there printings that have those types of citations? If not, do you think it‚Äôs important to have the exact context, or do you think the NT writers have all the context we‚Äôd need? Would the early church members know scripture well enough that they‚Äôd get the references? What about the gentiles?

xw6r43,toonguy762,Bible,Questions about pleasing God vs personal happiness,"1) I would like to know if playing video games or doing something daily is considered idolatry?  Because I'm reading the Bible and it says:


You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.

(Why do some people add extra things that aren't in the Bible like  for example that an Idol can be anything even a person or an object,( When it isn't even Biblical)  So I'm not allowed to love or admire anything?  or if I do something daily is considered idolatry? Then what about working? there are people who work daily and put their jobs before God , does this mean they are going to Hell because thry try to survive? Or  another thing lets say I have a job and I work to obtain certain materials, clothes, make up or toys, figurines that I desire, is this idolatry? If yes then what is the point of working if I still can't be happy?)


I'm kinda  beginner in being a real Christian but I feel like God placed me in a bondage and wants to take away my freedom. I try to please God and I try to always put him first when I wake up in the morning or when I sleep at night but I believe God wants me to live like a hermit in order to not be able to sin and this makes me really depressed. I feel like now if I know the truth about the Bible and I keep sining(playing video games or if I put make up on my face(I'm a woman) he will terminate my life. I feel like I live a very sheltered life I can't get new things like toys, fashion or materials because God will judge me and send me to Hell. I'm also being persecuted by Satan and his demons and they possess my friends and speak through them and tell me to give up reading the Bible or that no matter what I do I'm still a sinner and a hypocrite and this is true honestly. I try to give good advice to people but somethimes I don't follow my advice. I feel like I am able to follow almost all the commandments from the Bible but I feel depressed because this would mean I have to cut myself completely from the things I love and then whats the point of even being born or alive? just to sit and whatch how other people have fun and enjoy life?  I really feel mentally and pysically exausted from the persecution I get from Satan and his fallen angels, each night they try to make my life hell. They try to make me offers to join their faction, I rejected them and they try to descourage me either to give up the Bible or If I continue to read the Bible says I'm going to die because I continue to like Satan s products aka video games, toys, make up etc.

[https://christianmolk.com/2022/10/what-are-the-names-of-god-in-the-bible/](https://christianmolk.com/2022/10/what-are-the-names-of-god-in-the-bible/)

By far the most common name for God in the Bible is ‚ÄùYHWH‚Äù (◊ô◊î◊ï◊î) (pronounced ‚ÄúYahweh‚Äù). The name occurs about 6000 times and is usually translated as ‚ÄúLord‚Äù or ‚ÄúLORD‚Äù in English translations of the Bible. In the New Testament, YHWH corresponds to the Greek word ‚ÄúKyrios‚Äù (Œ∫œçœÅŒπŒøœÇ), which is translated as ‚ÄúLord‚Äù.

The second most common name for God in the Bible is the Hebrew ‚ÄùElohim‚Äù (◊ê÷±◊ú÷π◊î÷¥◊ô◊ù), which in the New Testament corresponds to the Greek ‚ÄúTheos‚Äù (Œ∏ŒµœåœÇ), and which is translated ‚ÄúGod‚Äù.

Yahweh/Kyrios and Elohim/Theos are by far the most common names for God in the Bible, and are sometimes used in combination, such as Yahweh Elohim or Kyrios Theos.

In biblical times, a name was more than just an address, it also said something about the character and personality of the person. When someone in the Bible is involved in something significant, it is not uncommon for the person in question to be given a new name, such as Jacob in connection with his wrestling with God:

>‚Äú*And he said to him, ‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúJacob.‚Äù* *Then he said, ‚ÄúYour name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.‚Äù* *Then Jacob asked him, ‚ÄúPlease tell me your name.‚Äù But he said, ‚ÄúWhy is it that you ask my name?‚Äù And there he blessed him.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ge 32:27‚Äì29**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2032.27%E2%80%9329)**)**

So for anyone who wants to get to know God, his character and personality, the Bible study of his name can be a very good start.

## El, Elohim, Eloah and Theos ‚Äì God

‚ÄúEl‚Äù simply means ‚ÄúGod‚Äù or ‚Äúgod‚Äù and is used in the Bible to refer to both God and idols. It is also not uncommon for God to be called ‚ÄúEl‚Äù + an attribute, such as ‚ÄúElyon‚Äù, (= the Most High).

>‚Äú*In the beginning, God \[Elohim\] created the heavens and the earth.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ge 1:1**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%201.1)**)**

‚ÄúElohim‚Äù is the plural form of ‚ÄúEl‚Äù and thus means ‚Äúgods‚Äù, but in Hebrew the plural form is also used to strengthen a word and in that sense Elohim is used as a proper name of God and is then translated as ‚ÄúGod‚Äù.

>‚Äú*Then he said, ‚ÄúI am God \[El\], the God \[Elohim\] of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.* *I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again, and Joseph‚Äôs hand shall close your eyes.‚Äù*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ge 46:3‚Äì4**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2046.3%E2%80%934)**)**

‚ÄúEloah‚Äù is the singular of the plural form Elohim and is translated ‚ÄúGod‚Äù. The fact that God is described in both singular and plural in the same word in the OT is a picture of the Trinity.

>‚Äú*But you are a God \[Eloah\] ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and did not forsake them.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ne 9:17b**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Neh%209.17b)**)**

## El Elyon, Hypsistos ‚Äì God Most High

In biblical times, each country or people had its own local gods. To make it clear that God is not just any local mini-god, but he is the One and the Most High, God is sometimes called El Elyon (◊ê÷µ◊ú ◊¢÷∂◊ú÷∞◊ô◊ï÷π◊ü), God the Most High.

>‚Äú*And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High \[El Elyon\].)‚Äù*  
**(**[**Ge 14:18**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2014.18)**)**  
>  
>‚Äú*I will be glad and exult in you; I will sing praise to your name, O Most High \[Elyon\].*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ps 9:2**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%209.2)**)**  
>  
>*‚ÄúAnd the angel answered her, ‚ÄúThe Holy Spirit \[Hagios Pneuma\] will come upon you, and the power of the Most High \[Hypsistos\] will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy‚Äîthe Son of God \[Huios Theos\].‚Äù*  
**(**[**Lk 1:35**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Luke%201.35)**)**

# Elohim Yisrael ‚Äì God of Israel

Not only is God not just any god, but he is also the God of *Israel*. God is the God of the whole world, but he has chosen to reveal himself to Israel, the people he has chosen. So to distinguish God from the idols of other peoples, who were also called ‚ÄúEl‚Äù, it is not uncommon for God to be described in the Bible as ‚ÄúElohim Yisrael‚Äù (◊ê÷±◊ú÷∏◊î÷º ◊ô÷¥◊©÷∞◊Ç◊®÷∏◊ê÷µ◊ú), the God of Israel, alternatively the God of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob:

>‚Äú*He said, ‚ÄúThen put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your heart to the Lord, the God of Israel \[Elohim Yisrael\].‚Äù*‚Äù  
**(**[**Jos 24:23**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Josh%2024.23)**)**  
>  
>‚Äú*And he said, ‚ÄúI am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.‚Äù And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ex 3:6**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%203.6)**)**

God is often referred to as the God of Israel in the context of God‚Äôs desire for Israel to be a holy people, distinct from the idolatrous peoples around them. God is not like the other gods.

The mention of God as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob often refers to the covenant God made with Abraham, of which Israel is a part ([Genesis 12:1-3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2012.1-3)). God is not just any God, but the God who made a covenant with Abraham and chose Israel as his people.

# El Shaddai, Pantokrator ‚Äì God Almighty

One of the names of God that stands out in the Old Testament is ‚ÄúEl Shaddai‚Äù (◊ê÷µ◊ú ◊©÷∑◊Å◊ì÷∑÷º◊ô). The original meaning of the word ‚Äúshaddai‚Äù is unclear, but is often translated as ‚Äúalmighty‚Äù and is the name God uses about himself when he reveals himself to Abraham:

>‚Äú*When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, ‚ÄúI am God Almighty \[El Shaddai\]; walk before me, and be blameless,*‚Äù   
**(**[**Ge 17:1**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2017.1)**)**

The name El Shaddai is often used in connection with God‚Äôs promise to Abraham of miraculous blessings, i.e. the point of the name is that nothing is impossible for God, he can do whatever he wants:

>‚Äú*God Almighty \[El Shaddai\]* *bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ge 28:3**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2028.3)**)**

The very meaning of God‚Äôs name El Shaddai recurs in the New Testament as well, for example when Jesus speaks of salvation and Peter thinks that no one can be saved:

>‚Äú*But Jesus looked at them and said, ‚ÄúWith man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.‚Äù*‚Äù  
**(**[**Mt 19:26**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%2019.26)**)**

As impossible as it was for Abraham to have a son at the age of 100, it is just as impossible for a human being to be saved. But because God is ‚ÄúEl Shaddai‚Äù, the Almighty, God can give Abraham an offspring and he can give birth to us again.

In the New Testament, the Greek equivalent ‚ÄúPantokrator‚Äù (œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒøŒ∫œÅŒ¨œÑœâœÅ) is also used to describe the miraculous participation of God‚Äôs people in Abraham‚Äôs covenant and to describe the enormity of God‚Äôs greatness:

>‚Äú*What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, ‚ÄúI will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.* *Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; then I will welcome you,* *and I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty \[Pantokrator\].‚Äù*‚Äù  
**(**[**2 Co 6:16‚Äì18**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Cor%206.16%E2%80%9318)**)**

# Yahweh, Adonijah and Kyrios ‚Äì The Lord

When the people of Israel are enslaved in Egypt, God appears to Moses at Mount Sinai and commissions him to lead Israel out of slavery. If God had previously made himself known to his people as ‚ÄúElohim‚Äù and to the patriarchs as ‚ÄúEl Shaddai‚Äù, it was now time for Israel to come to know God by his name ‚ÄúYahweh‚Äù:

>‚Äú*God spoke to Moses and said to him, ‚ÄúI am the Lord \[YHWH\].* *I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty \[El Shaddai\], but by my name the Lord \[YHWH\] I did not make myself known to them.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ex 6:2‚Äì3**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%206.2%E2%80%933)**)**

However, it should be added that God‚Äôs name ‚ÄúYahweh‚Äù as such was known to some even before God revealed it to Moses, but the very *meaning* and *significance* of God‚Äôs name Yahweh was first revealed to Israel through Moses. For example, [Genesis 4:26](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%204.26) states that at the time of the life of Adam‚Äôs son Seth *‚Äúpeople began to call upon the name of the LORD \[YHWH\]‚Äù*. Even Abraham must have known God‚Äôs name Yahweh because he calls the place where he did not sacrifice Isaac ‚ÄúYahweh Yir‚Äôeh‚Äù ([Genesis 22:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2022.14)), which means ‚ÄúYahweh provides‚Äù, a name which, incidentally, may be the basis for the name ‚ÄúJerusalem‚Äù.

But when God reveals himself to Moses and wants to send him to Pharaoh, Moses hesitates in the face of the mission and asks for God‚Äôs name, not because he necessarily wants to know God‚Äôs name but because he wants to understand who God is:

>‚Äú*But Moses said to God, ‚ÄúWho am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?‚Äù* *He said, ‚ÄúBut I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.‚Äù* *Then Moses said to God, ‚ÄúIf I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ‚ÄòThe God of your fathers has sent me to you,‚Äô and they ask me, ‚ÄòWhat is his name?‚Äô what shall I say to them?‚Äù* *God said to Moses, ‚ÄúI am who I am.‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúSay this to the people of Israel: ‚ÄòI am has sent me to you.‚Äô¬†‚Äù* *God also said to Moses, ‚ÄúSay this to the people of Israel: ‚ÄòThe Lord \[YHWH\], the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.‚Äô This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ex 3:11‚Äì15**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%203.11%E2%80%9315)**)**

The name ‚ÄúI Am Who I Am‚Äù expresses God‚Äôs character as eternal, absolute and unchanging. God is the one who ‚Äúis‚Äù. He has always existed, is not dependent on anyone and without him there is nothing. God is the one who is the truest of all that is true and the most eternal of all that is eternal.

In the New Testament, this is expressed above all in the Book of Revelation:

>‚Äú*‚ÄúI am the Alpha and the Omega,‚Äù says the Lord God \[Kyrios Theos\], ‚Äúwho is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty \[Pantokrator\].‚Äù*‚Äù  
**(**[**Re 1:8**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rev%201.8)**)**

A further explanation of what God‚Äôs name YHWH really means is given when Moses expresses uncertainty about himself with the words ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù and receives from God the succinct answer ‚ÄúI am with you‚Äù ([Exodus 3:12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%203.12)). This gives us a clue to what God‚Äôs name ‚ÄúYHWH‚Äù means. God is not a god who sits on pink clouds somewhere far away from our reality and who demands things from us from time to time. God is a God who is *with us*. When Moses questions his own strength in comparison to Pharaoh, God says that *he* will be with Moses. So Moses may be nothing in himself, but if God is with Moses, all possibilities are there. Just as God walked in the Garden of Eden before the Fall, so too in heaven God will be in our midst, and just as God came to earth 2,000 years ago and walked in our midst and worked miracles. God is not a distant God who is too big for us to come into contact with Him, no, ‚ÄúGod is with us‚Äù. It is therefore no coincidence that Isaiah prophesies that the Messiah will be called ‚ÄúImmanuel‚Äù ([Isa 7:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%207.14)). However, Jesus was not given the name ‚ÄúImmanuel‚Äù because it instead describes who he *is*. For ‚ÄúImmanuel‚Äù translates directly into English as ‚ÄúGod with us‚Äù and is an allusion to Jesus being the one in the Trinity who has come down to earth and ‚Äúis with us‚Äù. There is also a clear link here to the answer given to Moses by God: ‚ÄúI am with you‚Äù. When Jesus left us and flew up to heaven, he was careful to point out that from now on the Holy Spirit will be ‚Äúwith us‚Äù.

>‚Äú*Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Is 7:14**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%207.14)**)**

The answer Moses receives from God is that his name is ‚Äúehyeh asher ehyeh‚Äù (‚ÄúI am who I am‚Äù in English) and is shortened to ‚Äúehyeh‚Äù or ‚ÄúI am‚Äù. Of course, when Moses was about to say God‚Äôs name to the people of Israel, he could not say ‚Äú*I* am‚Äù but instead says ‚Äú*He* is‚Äù, which becomes ‚ÄúYHWH‚Äù and is usually pronounced ‚ÄúYahweh‚Äù. So, to be picky, YHWH is not the name that God presents himself with, but the name that Israel uses about God.

So YHWH is the name that Israel was allowed to use about God, but at the same time they were not allowed to misuse God‚Äôs name:

>‚Äú*And speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.* *Whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord \[YHWH\]* *shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Le 24:15‚Äì16**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Lev%2024.15%E2%80%9316)**)**

Because of this, with the exception of certain solemn occasions in the Temple, Israel was very restrictive in uttering God‚Äôs name. When they read the Bible aloud and it said ‚ÄúYHWH‚Äù, they read ‚Äúadonaj‚Äù (‚Äúlord‚Äù in English) instead.

To further remind themselves not to pronounce God‚Äôs name Yahweh, the vowels from the word ‚Äúadonaj‚Äù were sometimes used into the word ‚ÄúYHWH‚Äù in later Bible translations. In the original Hebrew text, vowels were not used, so when the reader read the consonants YHWH with the vowels from Adonaj, they were reminded to say Adonaj instead of Yahweh. The deliberate mispronunciation if read as written then became ‚ÄúJehovah‚Äù. According to linguists, a more correct and original pronunciation of God‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúYahweh‚Äù.

In the New Testament we also find that instead of pronouncing God‚Äôs name, it is chosen to say ‚Äúheaven‚Äù. Hence we have the expression ‚Äúkingdom of heaven‚Äù instead of the more common ‚Äúkingdom of God‚Äù, and hence we often say that we are going to *heaven* when we die, when what we really mean is that we are going to *God* when we die.

>‚Äú*From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, ‚ÄúRepent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.‚Äù*‚Äù  
**(**[**Mt 4:17**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%204.17)**)**

When the Old Testament was translated into Greek, they continued to avoid writing ‚ÄúYHWH‚Äù and instead wrote the Greek word ‚Äúkyrios‚Äù (‚Äúlord‚Äù in English). Since kyrios is a relatively common word and does not necessarily refer specifically to ‚ÄúYHWH‚Äù, it is sometimes difficult to know whether kyrios in the New Testament refers specifically to the Lord YHWH or some other lord whomever. To find out, one can look up the original Hebrew text when the Old Testament is quoted in the New Testament.

For example, Matthew quotes the prophet Isaiah when describing the mission of John the Baptist:

>‚Äú*For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, ‚ÄúThe voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‚ÄòPrepare the way of the Lord \[Kyrios\]; make his paths straight.‚Äô¬†‚Äù*‚Äù  
**(**[**Mt 3:3**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%203.3)**)**  
>  
>‚Äú*A voice cries: ‚ÄúIn the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord \[YHWH\]; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Is 40:3**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%2040.3)**)**

So here we see that it is not just any lord that John the Baptist will prepare the way for, but none other than ‚ÄúYHWH‚Äù himself!

This clear connection between YHWH, Kyrios and Jesus recurs throughout the New Testament, for example when Jesus, in conversation with the Pharisees, says he is ‚ÄúI Am‚Äù:

>‚Äú*I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am* *\[Ego Eimi\]* *he you will die in your sins.‚Äù*‚Äù  
**(**[**Jn 8:24**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%208.24)**)**  
>  
>‚Äú*Jesus said to them, ‚ÄúTruly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am \[Ego Eimi\].‚Äù* *So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Jn 8:58‚Äì59**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%208.58%E2%80%9359)**)**

The reason the Pharisees want to stone Jesus to death is because they believe he has blasphemed the name of the Lord according to the above-mentioned [Leviticus 24:15-16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Lev%2024.15-16). The Greek words ‚ÄúEgo Eimi‚Äù are the exact same words used in the Greek translation of the Old Testament where God presents his name to Moses as ‚ÄúI Am‚Äù in [Exodus 3:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%203.14). The Pharisees believes Jesus blasphemes the name of the Lord when he calls himself ‚ÄúEgo Eimi‚Äù / ‚ÄúI Am‚Äù, because that means he calls himself Yahweh. If any other person than Jesus had called himself Yahweh then the Pharisees would be right that he blasphemes, but Jesus is the only one who can truly call himself the Lord Yahweh without blaspheming.

Paul also addresses this topic in Philippians:

>‚Äú*who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,* *but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.* *And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.* *Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,* *so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,* *and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Php 2:6‚Äì11**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Phil%202.6%E2%80%9311)**)**

Paul writes that Jesus has been given the name that stands above all other names and clarifies that all should confess that Jesus is ‚Äúthe Lord‚Äù. As we have seen before, the word ‚Äúlord‚Äù is sometimes used instead of ‚ÄúYHWH‚Äù and to find out which ‚Äúlord‚Äù is meant, one must look at the context. Which name stands above all other names? Well, it is of course YHWH!

Paul writes: ‚Äú*because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord \[Kyrios\] and believe in your heart that God \[Theos\] ¬†raised him from the dead, you will be saved.* *For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.*‚Äù **(**[**Ro 10:9‚Äì10**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%2010.9%E2%80%9310)**)**

To base this in the Old Testament, Paul quotes the prophet Joel:

>‚Äú*For ‚Äúeveryone who calls on the name of the Lord \[Kyrios\]* *will be saved.‚Äù*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ro 10:13**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%2010.13)**)**  
>  
>‚Äú*And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord \[YHWH\] shall be saved.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Joe 2:32a**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Joel%202.32a)**)**

So what Paul is saying is that if you confess Jesus as the Lord YHWH, you will be saved. An example of such a confession is when Thomas encounters the risen Jesus:

>‚Äú*Thomas answered him, ‚ÄúMy Lord \[Kyrios\] and my God \[Theos\]!‚Äù‚Äù*  
**(**[**Jn 20:28**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2020.28)**)**

A further understanding of God‚Äôs name is given by linguists who argue that the verb is indefinable; the name could just as easily be ‚ÄúI *was*‚Äú, ‚ÄúI *am*‚Äù or ‚ÄúI will *be*‚Äú. God alludes to this when he says in [Revelation 1:8](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rev%201.8): *‚ÄúI am the Alpha and the Omega,‚Äù says the Lord God, ‚Äúwho is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty‚Äù*. So God is the one who has done wonders in the past and whom we are to remember and tell about. God is also the one who is with us today and with whom we can have a relationship. God is also the one who will intervene in the future and we can trust that what he says he will do, he will do.

# Yahweh Sebaot ‚Äì Lord of Hosts

The Hebrew word (◊¶÷∞◊ë÷∏◊ê÷∏◊î / sebaot) usually means ‚Äúarmies,‚Äù both human and angelic, but can also mean ‚Äúheavenly bodies‚Äù ([Genesis 2:1](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%202.1)). The word ‚Äúsebaot‚Äù is used some 242 times together with God‚Äôs name, Yahweh of hosts (◊ô◊î◊ï◊î ◊¶÷∞◊ë÷∏◊ê◊ï÷π◊™), and is then primarily a description of God as the one who rules over the heavenly armies. For example, when the Israelites and the Philistines are lined up against each other, David says to Goliath:

>‚Äú*Then David said to the Philistine, ‚ÄúYou come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts \[YHWH Sebaot\], the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.*‚Äù  
**(**[**1 Sa 17:45**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Sam%2017.45)**)**

David comes against a humanly overwhelming enemy backed by a heavenly army and therefore knows that he will win the duel. No matter how great an enemy we face, we are always superior if God is with us. Like when Elisha asks God to open his servant‚Äôs eyes to see that God‚Äôs army is greater than the army of the Arameans:

>‚Äú*When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. And the servant said, ‚ÄúAlas, my master! What shall we do?‚Äù* *He said, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.‚Äù* *Then Elisha prayed and said, ‚ÄúO Lord, please open his eyes that he may see.‚Äù So the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.*‚Äù  
**(**[**2 Ki 6:15‚Äì17**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Kings%206.15%E2%80%9317)**)**

More Scriptures about Yahweh Sebaot:

>‚Äú*Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host \[sebaot\] of them.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ge 2:1**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%202.1)**)**  
>  
>‚Äú*And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the Lord of hosts \[YHWH Sebaot\] who sits enthroned on the cherubim.*‚Äù  
**(**[**2 Sa 6:2**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Sam%206.2)**)**  
>  
>‚Äú*Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts \[YHWH Sebaot\], he is the King of glory! Selah*‚Äù  
**(**[**Ps 24:10**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%2024.10)**)**

# Pater, Abba ‚Äì Father

When Jesus teaches his disciples how to pray, he begins the example prayer ([Matt 6:9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%206.9)) by calling God ‚Äúpater‚Äù (œÄŒ±œÑŒÆœÅ), which in English translates ‚ÄúFather‚Äù:

>‚Äú*Pray then like this: ‚ÄúOur Father \[Pater\] in heaven, hallowed be your name.*‚Äù  
**(**[**Mt 6:9**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%206.9)**)**

‚ÄúFather‚Äù is by far the most common name for God that Jesus himself uses when talking about God. But when Jesus is in prayer, it seems that he rather calls God ‚ÄúAbba‚Äù (·ºàŒ≤Œ≤·æ∂), which is an Aramaic word (Jesus‚Äô native language) meaning ‚Äúdaddy‚Äù:

>‚Äú*And he said, ‚ÄúAbba \[Abba\], Father \[Pater\], all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.‚Äù*‚Äù  
**(**[**Mk 14:36**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Mark%2014.36)**)**

God being our ‚ÄúFather‚Äù is linked both to us being ‚Äúborn again‚Äù ([John 3:3-8](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%203.3-8)) and being ‚Äúa new creation‚Äù ([2 Corinthians 5:17](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Cor%205.17)) in that we are saved, and to us being made part of God‚Äôs people and God‚Äôs family in God‚Äôs promise to Abraham.

## Jesus ‚Äì Yeshua

Jesus‚Äô name, Joshua, Yeshua or Yehoshuah, is a contraction of the two Hebrew words ‚Äúyeho‚Äù, which is a word that comes from ‚ÄúYHWH‚Äù / ‚ÄúYahweh‚Äù, and ‚Äúshua‚Äù which means ‚Äúsalvation‚Äù or ‚Äúsave us!‚Äù. So all in all, Jesus‚Äô name becomes ‚ÄúGod saves us‚Äù or ‚ÄúGod the Saviour‚Äù, which is very consistent with Jesus being God who became man to save us.

>‚Äú*She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus \[Iesous\], for he will save his people from their sins.‚Äù*‚Äù

My mom and I have been doing a Christian podcast since March and it's been strictly voice with some nice cover art on youtube, Spotify, etc.  We're considering doing video instead or creating on-screen avatars (which I've seen done a lot in other genres but not so much Christian).  For those who don't know, an avatar is a picture that resembles us (one on the bottom left, the other on the right) and then the main portion of the screen would be illustrations, scriptures, etc.  Do you think that's something Christians would receive, or would you dislike something like that if you were watching?

xz82cl,DeSlacheable,JUSTNOMIL,Husband Is Back From FIL's Funeral,"My MIL is Mommy Fortuna, FIL died a week ago, I did not go to the funeral. 

Before the funeral there was major drama so he blocked her. She began calling on a multitude of other numbers and he kept his phone on do not disturb for a few days. She made several demands he didn't respond to.

The funeral itself was uneventful. She acted like nothing was wrong and nothing happened. DH is glad he went.

His BIL asked to drive him to the airport. He was expecting a lecture but got the opposite. His brother in law *knows*. He knows she's manipulative, and lies and is dangerous. He told stories that completely backed me up. I cried for like half an hour when DH told me. I feel so validated. I've been lied to and gaslit for so long. I feel so validated. I. am. not. crazy. BIL is in exactly my spot, with the entire family against him. I feel so sad. His wife, Mommy Fortuna's daughter, does not agree. She admitted to the lying, boundary stomping, screaming and the fact that MIL repeatedly exposes her grandkids to pedophiles, but she doesn't think any of those are worth damaging her relationship with her.

This will hopefully be it for a while. The only reason she's been an ongoing issue was FIL. Thank you again for everything.",325,0.98,1,/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/xz82cl/husband_is_back_from_fils_funeral/,2022-10-08 17:34:05,True

15 years of abuse from MIL, she got put on a 6 month timeout almost 2 years ago but it keeps resetting because she contacts us constantly.

This afternoon SIL texted ""Dad passed away"" so when MIL called he answered. He told her he's sorry, he would like to come to the funeral but can't afford it, and got off the phone. He came home early and turned his phone off because he figured she'd be a thing, which she has, unfortunately.

DH says he wants to go to the funeral. We have a ton in the air right now and I don't think it's happening. DH says he doesn't want to grey rock or ""play at politics"", he just wants to live normally and then restart the 6 months after the funeral. I know it's not fair to restart after the funeral but she just sent a guilt trip yesterday so it really doesn't matter. We can restart from yesterday and then restart again the day after the funeral when she calls and screams into his voicemail that he never should have left and she needs him there for 2 weeks. We aren't going to hold the funeral against her.

So. I have no idea what I'm asking. Just fix it, please. I don't know if he's going to the funeral. I don't know if he's talking to her tomorrow. I don't know how to support him.

y7fpb3,Animore,Bible,Question about the fulfillment of the law,"I know this is most likely a horse that's been beaten to death on this sub, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around it, having been recently trying to do an attentive study of the Bible. I recognize that Jesus had ""fulfilled"" the Law as he said, and in that sense I understand that most of the Mosaic Laws, such as the prohibitions on the consumption of certain food and certain types of sacrifices, probably don't apply to those who have repented and accepted Christ. But later, when he's having the discussion with the rich man over which laws to follow, he notes to follow the commandments.

Why would this be the case? I know later he states that the two greatest commandments, on which all the Law and the Prophets rely, are to love God and love your neighbor as you do yourself. But why specifically uphold the commandments, if the law is fulfilled in the sacrifice of Christ? I know he hasn't been sacrificed yet, but when he expounded upon the two greatest commandments, he hadn't been sacrificed there either.

Are the commandments just good summaries of the way that one might best ensure that they're loving god and their neighbor? Should we just look at the Mosaic Laws as good suggestions for upholding those two commandments now? And if that's not the case, but the 10 commandments still hold weight in themselves, why is that the case as opposed to other Mosaic laws?

yaddol,user-234522467898,AtlantaHawks,I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll see alot of post like this but‚Ä¶,"Could you imagine if we traded JC this offseason. After we lost to Miami even though I have absolutely loved JC I thought he had kind of finished his time in ATL, not bc of talent I just didn‚Äôt think it would be possible to get a player of DJM caliber without giving up JC. But holy shit without that finger injury he legit looks like a completely different player. VERY confident in his shot and is looking aggressive trying to create for himself, where as last year he was almost too unselfish. 

Also love that Nate has been feeding him when everyone else went cold, when last year half of us were probably screaming at the screen to give JC an offensive set or the ball. And that play where he ran the floor made me cream my pants. Never seen him even attempt to do that. ITS NOT A DYNAMIC DUO, ITS A BIG THREE.",37,1.0,0,/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/yaddol/im_sure_well_see_alot_of_post_like_this_but/,2022-10-21 20:54:47,True
y79bl7,user-234522467898,Bible,Have an Old testament question.,"When God is talking to Abraham about destroying Sodom, he says before in my translation ‚ÄúShould I tell Abraham‚Äù, this is probably the first time I‚Äôve seen an example of God basically mulling something over or ‚Äúthinking‚Äù but because he is omnipresent I always assumed he wouldn‚Äôt think he would just know.
Secondly, earlier on in the chapter when he blesses Hagar, what was his reason for doing so? Ik he doesn‚Äôt need a reason, I was just confused since God‚Äôs choosen people and Islam have been warring for thousands of years. 
Just a little confusion from todays reading and I‚Äôm interested to hear what you guys think. Obviously some question we may never know but I always think its cool to speculate.",8,0.91,0,/r/Bible/comments/y79bl7/have_an_old_testament_question/,2022-10-18 07:56:25,True
