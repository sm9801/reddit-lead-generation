irwnokq,thekuinshi,y1d9oq,How much are they charging? 👀
iryegak,neeeeonbelly,y1d9oq,"I don’t think I’d spend a ton on their seminar because their game is highly based around their attributes, which I do not have lol."
iry0shu,hifioctopi,y1d9oq,Any idea what they will be teaching?
is309my,InvisibleJiuJitsu,y1d9oq,"yes, here in the uk they did a leg pin passing seminar, well worth it. They explain things very nicely and answered all my little questions on why they were doing certain things and ""what ifs?"""
irwtiwy,AdSweaty5570,y1d9oq,Waste of money. Fuck that.
irzc9ch,AdSweaty5570,y1d9oq,"Downvote me all you want. The price of a seminar is usually the cost of an entire month of regular training or even more. Theres nothing magical you're gonna learn besides throwing your money down the drain. Seminars were for people with little to no access to the sport or internet connection. We no longer have these problems. Use your resources dumb asses. Especially for a fucking white belt. A white belt could talk to Kade for 12 hours straight and he's still gonna suck ass at BJJ. 

Stop thinking you can move like the Ruotolo bros just because you watch their seminar. As if there isn't countless free hours on YouTube already of how they move. Idiots."

itd2akq,varbav6lur,yaseov,"Yes, i think it is. But if you put your faith in Christ you will be saved."
itcmvi1,previous-solutions,yaseov,"According to the Bible, Hell is eternal. 

Below are 2 verses from Matthew 

Matt 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels  
  
Matt 25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

Here is another from Revelation

Revelation 20:10  
10 And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
itd8jsn,SnooRegrets4878,yaseov,"Hell is for real, and it is eternal. It was created for Satan and his followers. But those who reject God in this life, will be rejected by God in the afterlife."
itcvtr0,Inevitable_Ad183,yaseov,Yup. Forever. And ever. Never will end.
itd4cav,Wild_Hook,yaseov,"There are actually 2 ways in which the word ""hell"" is used in scriptures.

1. It is a temporary existence in the spirit world that will last until the end of the Millineum when death and hell are conquered. It is also called the spirit prison by Peter in First Peter 3:19. The wicked and those who never heard the gospel will be taught there and most will accept the merciful atonement of Christ.  ""For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.""  First Peter 4:6
2. It is the place where the sons of perdition go. These are those who have been taught the gospel and understand it but have an eternal hatred for God. These are Satan and his followers and those who have committed the unpardonable sin having known God through the power of the Holy Ghost and then rejected Him, of whom Christ said that all other sins would be forgiven (Matthew 12:31,32). This place is also called outer darkness because those who dwell there are eternally cast out of God's presence by their own choice. It is spiritual darkness, not an eternally burning tortuous hell. Here on earth, all people are enlightened to various degrees by our conscience or the light of truth, or the spirit of Christ, or""the true light that lighteth every man who comes into the world"" (John 1:9) I suspect that those in spiritual darkness will likely have no such light because they rejected it. These people will apparently be in torment. Wickedness does not produce happiness."
ite9hgw,DillonEspe,yaseov,"The lake of fire and Hell are different locations. Hell is a temporary holding location for the unsaved. After the great white throne judgment, the unsaved and satan and the antichrist and false prophet and all the demons go to the lake of fire for all eternity."
itcmsjw,,yaseov,Yes. It's eternal torment and punishment.
itczrph,Hanakos_ToiletWater,yaseov,yes. i don’t know why this is a debated topic in the first place.
itd679y,Malcolm3535Fighter,yaseov,Yes it’s for eternity means forever and forever no purgatory here your spirit lives on not your flesh.
itdn7dk,blue-pixie-,yaseov,"2 Thessalonians 1:9
They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might

Yes God is not a man that He should lie.

Numbers 23:19
God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

Mark 9:43
If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out


God does not lie, hell is punishment. The devil does lie, satan has been showing his followers a lie about what hell is like in their secret cult aka illuminati. They truly believe Satan’s lies of this false realm where hell is made to look like something it’s not. When they “transport” to other dimensions and stuff it’s all a deception of Satan, but these people think they are clued into something others don’t know. They do horrible things in secret and believe satan will make them powerful in hell or something. An ego that causes them eternal damnation unless they repent quickly. Some people just have too big of an ego to believe, but we all need repentance. We all have sinned which is why the blood of Jesus is needed for everyone to have everlasting life.

Revelations 20:10
And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
itczsjb,MashmallowRabbit,yaseov,"I think the question is tricky. As has been said before, everybody agrees that there is an eternal fire prepared for the devil and it’s angels Matt25:41

The questions is whether the souls will be suffering forever on the fire. Truth is, nobody knows but the more I think about it, I think the answer is no.

Matthew 10:28–Rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

James 4:12–There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.

Philippians 3:19–Whose end is destruction.

2 Thessalonians 1:9–Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction

The idea that souls are kept burning in hell implies that souls cannot be destroyed but Matt 10:28 clearly shows that they can.

It seems that after people die they are no more until one day God will raise them to the judgement of Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:10. Then, for some, comes the second death.

I don’t remember the bible verse but it made parallels with hell and sodom and Gomorrah. Fire and brimstone came and the place was reduced to ashes.. that is why it is a second death. Otherwise, it would not be called a second death.

Seems to me that the second death is achieved by means of an eternal fire"
itd7lcz,Talancir,yaseov,Yes.
itcmcno,JustToLurkArt,yaseov,That’s hotly debated. The only consensus is it’s torment and totally avoidable.
itdou4d,Serpentine878,yaseov,Yes
itduz0h,shawnintexas,yaseov,Ok ive seen some comments where people are saying hell is for eternity.  The scripture never says this. The scripture says hell is forever so yes it has a beginning and it will have an end. That is what forever is. Heaven is eternal and only Heaven. How long is forever is anyones guess but to be seperated totally from God for even a second would feel like an eternity.

itdf68p,itbwtw,yaseov,"There are quite a few orthodox opinions on Hell in Christianity. Most of us are only familiar with the one point of view we were raised with.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_in_Christianity

The idea that God will not leave anyone unsaved has been a valid perspective throughout Christian history. This ultimately is the view that God cannot lose and that God's love can and will successfully 'woo' and convert everyone before 'it is finished'.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_universalism"
itdwhdp,RoyalBird9,yaseov,"Are you worried about your salvation? Know that those who put their faith in Christ are saved from hell, which is in fact eternal, and gain eternal life in Him (Romans 6:23). If you’re having trouble, ask God to help guide you in your life. He will never turn one away who cries out to Him. If you want, my DMs are open if you would like to talk. I’m here for you, friend! Take some time to read the word and relax, knowing that Jesus has you, just pray and trust on Him. God bless, I love you my brother ❤️✝️👍"
itejubi,Serpardum,yaseov,"According to Jesus, yes:

Matthew 21:31 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you. 

Well, dang, that's the kingdom of God which is of the mind, not heaven.

But, no, it is just an eternity.

An eternity is when all you can remembered is s being in hell. You can not remember  anything else. At this point time is s meaninglessness because he'll is all you know, all you have ever known, and all you will know.

Perhaps eventually you will repent, but it may take yet another eternity."

itdc32p,everyoneinside72,yaseov,Yes 😞
itdjbah,TroutFarms,yaseov,"I think what you mean to ask is whether people who end up in hell must suffer eternally. There's three positions on this:

1. Yes, hell is eternal conscious torment. This is the dominant view within Christianity today and has been popular since the 4th Century.
2. No, those who are not saved will eventually cease to exist; any suffering in hell they may have to endure is temporary. This view is referred to as *annihilationism* or *conditional immortality* and has always been a minority opinion. the only major denomination I'm aware of that teaches this is the Adventists (Seventh Day Adventists and their offshoots).
3. No, there will come a time when everyone is saved; any suffering in hell is temporary. This is referred to as universalism. This was the dominant view within Christianity in the patristic era but fell out of favor and is a minority view today.

Whether hell is for ever or not is a different and far less interesting question. Many universalists believe hell **is** for ever and it will remain there for eternity...empty; a constant reminder of God's ultimate victory and the triumph of God's love."
itdwq3e,Mayhem2a,yaseov,Unfortunately
itdxozs,artgreendog,yaseov,Yes. The only thing keeping a person out of heaven is unbelief.
ite791n,my_solution_is_me,yaseov,"What is eternity?  I say it's right now.  The eternal now.  Its always right now.  When will it not be?

If you sin (move away from God) you are damned (spiritual progression is halted) and you are in hell (you are removed from God's presence).  
Hell occures in this life. The here and now. It's not a future punishment. We punish ourselves with thoughts and actions.   

People will answer with what they think... truth is nobody knows.  God is merciful and just.  Jesus died for all our sins.  
The Bible says things and it's up for interpretation,  just as I interrupted it above.  My interpretation comes from being a drug addict for 26 years.   I was in hell.  And accepting God brought me out.  Just as Jesus says in the new testiment the Kingdom of God is within you.  Not later, but now.  Right now!  

As a Mormon we do not belive in a literal burning hell but various degrees of glory.   All will get glory to what degree is up to you.  Hell is right here and now if you make choices that take you there."

itdwsxi,RoyalBird9,yaseov,"He’s probably just worried and looking for comfort. To that I say, blessed are those who are worried and uncomfortable, for God has them and is able to make them feel right again. I was once also worried about hell a lot, sometimes still am, but I just remember that Jesus Christ saved me from my sin on the Cross. So it’s understandable for him to feel this way."
itd3cpk,finallygotmeone,yaseov,"Agreed.

I think people don't want to think that our God could ever punish people forever, even though, as above, it's stated in scripture many times.  In fact, the Bible talks much more about Hell than Heaven.

They also don't like the idea that there is no fixing it once you die.  No one can pray you in, there's no Purgatory, there's no doing your time.  Your decision will be made in this lifetime and it's final."
itde229,Siege_Bay,yaseov,"""Shall be punished with everlasting destruction."" 

The Bible does speak about a future destruction for unbelievers, but it's important to note that they will be punished with an everlasting destruction. That's their punishment. Everlasting destruction. 

People say ""destruction"" cannot go on forever because when something is destroyed it's gone. Yet, the Bible speaks about the punishment being *everlasting* destruction."
itcxqlk,themaicero,yaseov,Totally avoidable is debatable to some (sovereign election ). Not saying I believe that just sharing what’s a pretty popular view.

itcrmiy,IsaacPaulB,yaseov,What verse is that?
iteqpe9,ThomasTheToad,yaseov,"From my perspective it's a choice that we make: to be with God or to not be with God. And He honors that choice, so if we reject Him we are separated from Him."
itdj3ud,MashmallowRabbit,yaseov,"But, as you said, once something is destroyed, it is destroyed forever. I think it makes sense to say everlasting in this case as to differentiate between the death and the everlasting death"
itczzqa,JustToLurkArt,yaseov,"Enormously safe that saved by grace through faith is the consensus throughout the majority of Christendom. 


Can you justify ""a pretty popular"" view for sovereign election?"
itcmx4a,HonestGodQuestions,yaseov,"I hold to the teachings of early Church Fathers like St. Gregory of Nyssa and especially St. Isaac the Syrian that the punishment in hell is medicinal and corrective, not retributive and eternal. It's pains are akin to the cauterization of a wound or the amputation of a diseased limb; the sufferings are real, but they exist for our good and will come to an end when the patient is healed."
itdx7yr,jakoooon,yaseov,"The imagery goes both ways. Many of Jesus' parables describe an immediate and permanent destruction, but not one that lasts forever. The OT tends to use those kinds of images too. Revelation uses images of eternal punishment as well as some of Jesus' other parables. To me, the safest understanding is to say the Bibles intent was not to describe the physical reality of hell, but rather to encourage people to get right with God so they can avoid the judgement on the last day whatever it ends up looking like. 

So personally, I go with the OT prophets. Immediate and permanent but only lasting for a moment. But I could be wrong."
itd82hu,HonestGodQuestions,yaseov,"I do not believe that the Bible does teach that people suffer in hell forever.

I am Orthodox, so I do not believe in Purgatory as the Catholics understand it. However the view of hell I have is essentially the same as how the Catholics would view Purgatory, in holding that everyone there is eventually healed of their sin and their sufferings come to an end with their experience of heaven eventually."
iteuy7m,Crunchy_Biscuit,yaseov,Definitely. It's just life isn't easy and not everyone starts on the level. Life is too chaotic how we choose. In order for God to be just He must be equitable not just equal
itdjg6n,Siege_Bay,yaseov,"Typically, once something is destroyed it's gone. 

God specifies and says this destruction will be everlasting. This is the punishment. 

People say, ""Destruction can't be everlasting! Something can't burn forever and still be there!"" I would say God can do anything. He can cause a bush to burn and be on fire but not be burned up. He can punish someone with everlasting destruction and them never be fully destroyed."

itdl6zz,MashmallowRabbit,yaseov,Is there a Bible verse that says that souls (other than the devil) will be tormented for eternity?
itdhfgx,howbot,yaseov,"Just some corrections:

It’s “Arminian.” “Armenians” are a people group from Armenia. 

Arminians and Calvinists are often held up as having opposing positions in this issue, with Arminians believing in conditional election and Calvinists believing in unconditional (sovereign) election. 

I’m not certain, but I think all the people you mentioned are Reformed/Calvinists, and neither Arminian nor Armenian."
itcyn1t,HonestGodQuestions,yaseov,"Sure it does. I've received injuries and pains that caused suffering, and through medicinal and corrective treatment they no longer do.

I hold that hell is essentially this, a medicinal and corrective application of God's love on those who, due to their sin-diseased spirit, cannot experience God's love as intended. Christ is our Physician, and his treatments are perfect."
itdfjqc,HonestGodQuestions,yaseov,"I vehemently disagree. St. Gregory of Nyssa and St. Isaac the Syrian are expressing Universalism, they are specifically saying that every created being is reconciled to God, and St. Isaac especially goes out of his way to say that the pains of Gehenna are temporary and medicinal. Neither of these are referencing purgatory in any way, they are preaching universal reconciliation."
itdlhox,themaicero,yaseov,"They are reformed. Correct. I didn’t say they were Arminian.  

Thanks for the spelling correction. Got carried away on my phone and didn’t notice I had spelled it wrong. 

My only point is election is not necessarily a minority concept. That’s all I wanted to convey."
itczpqq,HalflingMelody,yaseov,"It was ""medicinal and corrective treatment"" that healed you.  Not the suffering."
itdn3p6,howbot,yaseov,I must have misunderstood. I took “Pretty well all Calvinist and Armenians” to mean you were including the latter in the reformed (sovereign election) group.

itd2tkj,HonestGodQuestions,yaseov,"No, it is not the suffering that causes the healing, it's the healing that causes the suffering.

That's my point, the pains of hell aren't the point of hell, the healing which causes the pains is the point of hell."
itd30et,HalflingMelody,yaseov,"So, back to my point, then.  Suffering doesn't cause healing."
itd63xh,rbibleuser,yastpf,"Short answer: yes

Longer answer: Hell (the ""lake of fire"" which Jesus and others warned of) is an eternal place of punishment, see the references given elsewhere in this thread. At the end of all things, Death and Hades (the realm of the dead) will be cast into the lake of fire (which we generally call ""hell"" in English), along with Satan and his angels, the Beast and the false prophet, and anyone whose name is not written in the book of life.

You will sometimes hear things along the lines: ""Every child is born a sinner and all sin is so evil and offensive to God that he must cast it into hell and burn it forever. Therefore, even a child who dies without salvation is thrown into hell."" This line of discussion is a complete and total failure to take the text seriously -- it is nothing but baseless speculation passed off as having something to do with the Bible when, in fact, it has nothing to do with it.

Here are some relevant considerations:

- God is more just than we are, not less. If we can plainly see that something is unjust, so can God. This inborn moral sense (part of the image of God within us) is *why* we are liable for our actions before God. So if God himself were to undermine that by saying something like, ""burning this baby forever in the flames of hell might *seem* unjust to your puny mortal minds but, in fact, according to my transcendent holiness, it is actually just"", he would be undermining the very basis of our own liability to divine judgment for our actions!

- Sin is deadly and, ultimately, leads to hell. Even though no one can just ""slip"" into hell, the warnings of Scripture are clear: each sin, no matter how small, is a first step down a path that, ultimately, leads to eternal death. The reason that the terrifying imagery of a lava-lake is used in Scripture is that we ought to be as motivated to escape sin and hell as we would be to avoid the edge of a cliff over which there is a literal lava-lake. The danger is so great that we are instinctively motivated to run as far away as possible. Someone who dances on the edge of a cliff where there is a lava-lake below is reckless and has gone mad. Scripture warns that, when we indulge in sin, we are like that person dancing on the edge of the cliff -- reckless and mad.

- The lake of fire or the Abyss is not God's torture-dungeon where he burns naughty boys and girls for all of eternity for being smart-mouths or snatching each others' bread rolls. Rather, it's a cosmic structure that is an eternal opposite of the being of God. We can find ""the deep"" (Hebrew: `tehom`) mentioned in Genesis 1:2, where the Spirit is hovering over it; compare to Rev. 14:9-11. Clearly, this is not something that God created, because it is already there in verse 2, before the six-day creation. This is why the New Testament describes damnation as a kind of ""letting go"" or ""giving up"" or ""casting out"" -- God is not dragging people off into his torture dungeon, rather, he is casting the damned out of his own Creation (order, peace, love) into the untamed wilderness of the Abyss. It is as Jesus described it: a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth, where the fire is never quenched and the worm never dies.

- God is inherently reluctant to destroy the wicked. He is more reluctant to destroy the wicked than any just human is to punish the guilty (Ez. 33:11). The Bible speaks extensively about God's patience and long-suffering in enduring the crimes of the wicked upon the righteous. This is one of the reasons believers are called to suffer on behalf of Jesus -- our acceptance of the crimes of the wicked is part of how God is able to forgive them... and we were once in the very same position, 1 Cor. 6:11.

- There is such a thing as an infinite sin and the only proper punishment for it is eternal death, Rom. 3:8b. Once again, no one ever ""slipped"" into committing such sin, but the blasphemy of the Jews who hated Jesus (John 8:12-59) and the betrayal of Judas show us a picture of ""the end of the road"", the final point of reprobation beyond which there is nothing but wrath, Heb. 10:26,27. All sin, even minor sin, is a first step on the path whose final destination was reached by Judas and the Jews who crucified Jesus. It is a fate so terrifying that we can hardly bear to contemplate it and, therefore, we ought to abhor sin, we ought to abhor taking even that first step along a path whose final destination is so horrific."

The Lake of Fire is a real place and is where those who do not pass the Judgment go. All that are sent to the Lake of Fire will be destroyed. This is for all eternity.
Only those who are not written in The Book of Life will be sent to the Lake of Fire. Those who are written in the Book of Life will receive the Crown of Life, which is everlasting life.

Matthew 10:28 “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”

Revelation 20:15 “And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.”"

itd4pwn,Unlikely-sheK5463,yastpf,"For those who do not receive Jesus Christ as Savior, death means *everlasting* punishment (2 Thessalonians 1:8–9"
itdt4cp,mrcleeves,yastpf,"Yes but also no. The Punishment is forever, meaning the people who go to hell will never go to heaven. However it does not mean they will be burning forever. It says in the Bible only the saved will have eternal life, if one is to be burned forever it means they will have to be alive forever so they can be burned. This makes no sense. Therefore the more likely interpretation is that the fire is temporary, and you burn until it’s your time to die (this applies for everyone, including satan).

This is reinforced in Act 2:27 when Peter quotes David saying “thou shall not leave my soul in hell”. Until Jesus paid it all on the cross, your sins we’re covered. Not paid for.

The NT equivalent would be either abussos, the abbyss or Tartarus

Matt 24:46 does not contain a word, that is translated to hell

2. Tess 1 talks about ""eternal destruction"" in the blazing fire, so it can be assumed it talks about ""gehenna"", the lake of fire and brimstone, mentioned in revelation. This lake is said to habe satan tortured for ever, meaning it is indeed eternal. As Tessalonians mention, a human would just be destroyed for ever, being of the flesh. Picture a human falling in a volcano.

The translations use hell for many words like : sheol, bottomless pit, gehenna, the abyss, hades, tartaros and a few more.

Now, as established, gehenna, the lake of fire is eternally existing, to torture satan.

Sheol, the place where the souls are stored, will no longer be necessary after the Judgement, therefore it can be speculated, that it at least would lose its function.

https://biblehub.com/hebrew/7585.htm

Abussos, the Abyss can either refer to Sheol, or the prison pit Tartaros.

Tartaros would be the place where fallen angels are kept, either for eternity or judgement.

They are as gone as gone can be  **Ecclesiastes 9:6**   Do you believe this is true?

We were created out of organic matter from this earth, including air, but that wasn't all. Adam needed something to make him live. Had God not breathed into Adam's nostrils he would have just laid there until he rotted and went back to the dust he was taken from. Did God breathe air into Adam's nostrils?  No, God is Spirit. **John 4:24**   Jesus breathed on His disciples and they didn't receive air, they received the Holy Spirit   **John 20:22**    Man was created a living being. The being part is our flesh, but would not live without the living part our spirit.  The Bible says our spirit knows our thoughts. The person who dies actually goes to two different places

*and the golden bowl is broken;*  
*before the pitcher is shattered at the spring,*  
*and the wheel broken at the well,*  
 *and* ***the dust returns to the ground it came from,***

itdx357,rbibleuser,yastpf,"> Death and Hell are thrown into Hell?

Death and Hades first show up in 6:8, ""I looked, and there before me was a pale horse! Its rider was named Death, and Hades was following close behind him. They were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword, famine and plague, and by the wild beasts of the earth.""

The rider is named Death, and ""Hades"" is following close behind. Based on some reading, it is my opinion that ""Hades"", here, is a reference to ""the dead"", it is just the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew `sheol`. So, John is saying that the realm of the dead has been spilled upon the earth and they are following their leader, here called Death, but who we know is ultimately Satan. So, the rider of this horse is Satan, and he is leading the realm of the dead out upon the earth to kill a fourth of those still alive. In addition, the judgment imagery is a reference to Ezekiel 14:21 and [related passages](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=sword+famine+plague&resultspp=250&version=NIV).

When ""death and hell"" are cast into the lake of fire in Rev. 20:14, it is another way of saying that Satan and his angels are cast into it, that is, Satan and all among the dead who have chosen to join him in eternal death. This is the second death. It is my view that this first/second death pattern has to do with the role of choice in damnation -- the first death was something you had no choice in, but your second death is something you knowingly choose (see Rev. 13 and the mark of the Beast, etc.)

In Genesis 1:1, we read that God created two things: (a) the heavens and (b) the earth. Later, in Genesis 7:11, we see that ""the deep"" (`tehom`) first mentioned in Genesis 1:2 (before the six-day creation) bursts forth upon the earth, drowning everything that has the breath of life, except for those upon the Ark. We find this deep mentioned again (by implication) in Exodus 20:4: ""Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water **under the earth**."" It is my view that this pattern is not accidental -- prior to the Flood, the deep (`tehom`) was restrained so that it could not burst forth upon God's good creation. During the Flood, God unleashes the deep to extinguish the fires of open-air satanic wickedness upon the earth mentioned in Gen. 6:5. The point is that God had created a 2-level cosmology in Genesis 1,2, but now we find ourselves living in a 3-level world... heavens, earth and the underworld (`sheol`). The underworld did not appear from any doing of God, it appeared as a result of human disobedience.

So, the casting of death and Hades (or `sheol`, the realm of the dead) into the lake of fire is simply the returning of the underworld back to the place from which it came -- the deep is going back to the deep. In other words, this verse should be read as the ""un-Flood"", the undoing of the damage done by the Flood, which was made necessary by the aforementioned disobedience and wickedness of mankind.

I know that's a long reply to a simple question, but you're right that the wording is definitely eye-catching, especially in modern English where we conflate both the grave (`sheol`) and the lake of fire as ""hell""."
itezm0m,rbibleuser,yastpf,">Your comments were incredibly informative, even though I agreed with them already.

Glad to hear it!

> Do you have any book recommendations or insight as to where you came to hold these views?  

For me, it's just been a long journey of hearing sermons, comparing to Scripture and thinking ""that don't make no sense"" and then digging deeper into the Word.

The best place to start is the Bible itself, you can find all the relevant texts at [BibleHub](https://biblehub.net/searchtopical.php?q=hell).

As for the Hebrew cosmological side of things, I study it in two ways. The first is to just look at what the text *says*. Over the years, I find that the Bible is much more exact than I ever suspected it to be. The words chosen, the phrasing, what is included, what is left out. It's shockingly exact and the more you default to ""it was said this way on purpose"", the easier it is to understand the text. This is the opposite of the secular academic tendency to assume that the biblical authors were constantly screwing up, choosing the wrong words, confusing definitions, editing older texts to suit themselves, changing oral tradition, swapping out the names of gods, engaging in ""cultural appropriation"", and so on and so forth. The sooner you (generic) get that noise out of your head, the better. If the word `tehom` is used in one place, and in another place, that connection between those is significant. For me, this connected ""the great springs of the deep"" in Genesis 7:11 with Genesis 1:2, ""the deep"".

The second way is to look at some of the apocryphal sources and tradition, such as *Enoch*. Care is required because there is a lot of qabbalistic mumbo-jumbo out there. But it can help paint a more 3D picture of what's going on than just working from the Tanakh alone.

> I’m extremely fascinated by how ancient people viewed the world, especially the ancient Israelites and their cosmology of the waters above the firmament and below the land. As well as jewish apocalyptic literature like Revelation and all the symbolism that ties into the rest of Jewish scripture

As I said, my journey has just been piecemeal, so there is no one book (besides the Bible) that I can point you to. I do recommend Jonathan Pageau's YouTube channel because he explains a lot of cosmic symbolism from a biblical perspective. [This talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXGdaJFIB8M) is a good place to start. This is very helpful because he helps explain how the biblical authors are actually speaking a universal/cosmic language that we find in all religions, myths, cultures and stories. The same symbolic structures emerge in every culture because all cultures go back to Adam and, thus, to God. Symbolism is not arbitrary, it's ""encoded"" into the structure of reality, because well-ordered things are, in some sense, ""compelled"" to be the way they are, kind of like the laws of physics, but these are laws of symbolism. Yes, they're more ""fuzzy"" than physical laws, but in the limit, they are just as unalterable. Anyway, it's very eye-opening stuff. Some spiritual maturity is required, so if you (generic) feel that you're in over your head, seek some spiritual guidance/counsel. Don't just go it alone and then get lost in the deep dark forest..."

Also the Bible mentioned that eternity with God is many times more wonderful then the short span of our lives and trials here. God clearly notes that duration is a significant part of moral measure. This lends more support to the idea that eternal burning is not equal to a short life of sin.

Unquenchable fire does not mean stuff exists in it forever. Quite the contrary. The verse on their worm does not die, is a reference to Isaiah 66 and is in context to dead bodies decomposing and being consumed. 
Rev 14 is reference to destruction of armies of Armageddon that took the mark. Notice it’s in the presence of the Lamb while the lake of fire is away from the presence in 2 Thess 1.

Fact: Thoughts and prayers cost nothing. Relevant action does. 

We have 100-200m christians. If they actually gave a fuck about their neighbour, the world would be utopia. 

Funny how preachers always pray for donations to help the needy, but the ones most in need are always themselves. 

Save your prayers, go help a homeless person turn their life around instead."
itexmbe,Competitive_Intern78,yastpf,"1 Corinthians 6:9-10 says that among these others which I will not mention, thieves will not have a part in the kingdom of god and also in Revelation 22:14 & 15 that there is the holy city but on the outside are people who I think you should look for yourself. What this means is outside of the new universe exist people in the lake of fire, so yes, thieves are included in those who offend the infinite god of the Bible."
itdgqz3,BakerGlittering9856,yastpf,"The translation is pretty clear (Rev 20:10)

>And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

However in the basic text, we have the word for ""age"" (forever) and ""aion"" (and ever) which can stretch from a cycle to infinity.

https://biblehub.com/greek/165.htm

I am not an expert in the language, but i guess there is a reason, why they wrote ""for ever and ever"", which would mean infinitely.

So if you mean the consistency of the place, it would very likely be there for ever, since satans punishment is eternal torture ( as well as the 2 beasts of Revelation )."

iteytv1,coreydh11,yastpf,I’m not asking if stealing is a sin. I’m asking how can a finite being sin an infinite amount of times? If you rob a finite being is that less sinful than if you rob an infinite being? Why should the punishment be different for an infinite being if the sin is the same?
itez3w6,Competitive_Intern78,yastpf,"It doesn’t matter if stealing is an infinite offense, those who steal offend an infinite and holy god who is eternal, and we are made in the image of that infinite god, which means our souls (spirits) are eternal."
itezoyv,coreydh11,yastpf,"You’re purposely ignoring the point I’m getting at. Why should stealing something once be deserving of infinite punishment? Is the punishment infinite because the sin is against an infinite being? If you rob someone, should your punishment change based on how rich they are?"
itf0chb,Competitive_Intern78,yastpf,"I can say the same thing to you in terms of ignoring my answer to you. Unlike us who are bound to time, God is outside of time. So while the sin(s) we commit in this life are finite for a fixed time, God forever sees it again and again as it/they is/are recorded in the books as it says in Revelation 20:12, and he cannot and will not tolerate it, so sin while finite in this life to us is eternal to God within the books of our life that shows our every thought, word or deed, and if you do not take the grace of that is given to you by Christ, your sins within the book of your life will be intact and you will stand before him as they are revealed to to God, all of resurrected humanity and all of Gods warrior-like angels before you hear the 3 words that will be the last & worst thing to hear from the mouth of God, “Depart from Me”."

itdxwoh,AshenRex,yawd9f,"In the Old Testament, sometimes ages and time spans are less literal and more reflective of a short, medium, or long period of time. Sometimes it’s a generational reflection. Sometimes it’s a mysterious theological point. The idea is not to get hung up on the time span and instead focus on what occurred. They’re recording a significant event, such as a season of peace to a nation birthed and constantly in war or conflict is very significant."

itdl5aw,user_857732,yawd9f,It is a subset of numbers in a set of numbers that are not all rounded to forty; that suggests it is not a rounded number. If also in Paul's tally he used numbers that were not rounded and numbers that were rounded how much sense would that make; it would be inconsistent.
itdx0gz,labotomizeme05,yawd9f,"This is a fascinating bible study idea, though, it seems to come near “numerology”. Or am I overthinking? I am genuinely curious for an opinion;  I think it would be fun to find parallels in lists of Scripture where these specific numbers are used!"
itdune9,thetruthiseeit,yawd9f,"You mean it can also signify that because the phrase ""the land had rest for 40 years"" doesn't signify trials and sufferings."
itdyisn,thetruthiseeit,yawd9f,So maybe Jesus didn't actually spend 40 days on earth after his resurrection according to Acts? Interesting.
itf3wu2,Jamesybo555,yawd9f,"I disagree.  Numbers are very important to God. When He writes 40 years, it means 40 years."

All of us think we're well-read and confident we know exactly how to interpret scripture. You're really seeing who's the most confident, not the most correct.

I recommend reading ""How to Read the Bible"" by Rob Bell. I believe that book (which reads well as an audiobook) will help you better understand what the Hebrews were saying in verses like this."
itf4j57,hikaruelio,yawd9f,Yeah. I am not sure how that can apply here.
iterfq8,AshenRex,yawd9f,"I prefaced that with the Old Testament. The New Testament and Gospels are entirely different genres and types of writing. It’s important to understand what we’re referencing, their context, and our own interpretive bias."
itf6qce,AshenRex,yawd9f,"Do you mean inspired the writers to write 40 years? Careful friend, very few places does God dictate.  How would God judge us saying something God didn’t say? How does our modern understanding clash with the ancient ways people explained or recorded their experiences of God?

And where does God dictate what these numbers mean? It’s human interpretation that gives it significance."
itescz9,thetruthiseeit,yawd9f,"Ok, but it's mighty suspicious that Jesus also spent 40 days in the desert as well."

Essentially it's like a phone, say a company makes 1 million phones and 5% complain. That's not a large amount as it's only 5000 **(correction: 50000)** defective phones, but if those 5% are consistently loud about the issue others will believe all of those phones are like that."

iptyyqi,UsagiHakushaku,xnav4n,"We don't believe that , thats how muslims believe but there are like 20 different versions of Quran.

We believe there were inspired writing but we have copies of them with human error passed to us , however these errors do not affect major doctrines it's mostly names , dates or numbers corrupted, might be a vers missing  from psalms about praising Lord or wrong town in Old Testament said in one place but correct in two others.

Still Bible is correct over 99%  and it's the most preserved ancient text out there on earth.

You aren't required to be Bible scholar to be believer, early Christians didn't even have  New Testament nor could they read Old because it was in Hebrew and they were common people, some couldnt even read to begin with."
ipsrt17,ThroughHisGrace,xnav4n,"Genesis describes God's appointing of humans as rulers of this Earth. We see from the Bible that God's main method of working with His appointed rulers is *through* humans.

The Bible also teaches us that it doesn't really matter who that human is; Who was Moses before He became God's deliverance through the Exodus? Who was David before he became one of the most notable kings of the Isrealites? And that's pretty much the point, isn't it? That we are all nobody's without Him.

So in believing the Bible is God's word doesn't mean it matters who physically authored it, just that its a recorded book of His works and teachings."
ipszyyg,Traditional_Bell7883,xnav4n,"Even though we do not know the human authors of some of the books, they share a coherence and consistency with other books such that the unity as a whole is clear to those who have studied the Bible and read it from cover to cover. We are convicted that it is not just a hodge-podge collection of random writings. No other collection of books in the world written over such breadth of time and space by more than 40 different authors has ever come close to this level of unity. Those in the faith attribute it to divine inspiration, which is quite difficult to explain to non-Christians, more so to those who have never even read or studied the Bible. The thinking goes that, if there is indeed an invisible hand  (divine inspiration), the human writers were merely agents or instruments and their identity therefore does not really matter. Just like if your organisation issues a formal letter on letterhead, it doesn't really matter who actually typed the letter or, in some instances, even who composed the letter. We see this frequently in professional services firms. Such is the case with audit reports in the financial statements (or annual report) of companies. The Audit Partner signing off on the audit report signs the firm's name (eg. ""PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP"") and not his own name or those of the actual people who conducted the audit. Who is he and who performed the audit? Actually, it doesn't really matter as the audit firm as a whole stands behind the quality of the work done and audit opinion issued. The reader of the report trusts in the firm's brand and the knowledge that the audit profession is regulated, standards are in place, etc., sufficient to rely on the audit attestation and invest his money in the said company. This is as close an analogy as I can use to explain how Christians can trust the Bible without knowing the authors of the individual books.

Similarly, if you buy a chair, do you know the names of the carpenters or guys who built it? Yet you trust it enough to be able to support your weight and you proceed to sit on it? Well, it is because of other attributes -- the chair looks and feels sturdy, was bought from a reputable store, maybe it has a well-known brand like Herman Miller, the manufacturer is confident enough to provide a 10-year defects warranty, etc.

Similarly, when we take the Bible and look at its unity from Genesis to Revelation, the way it has changed lives, the way it is corroborated by secular historians, archaeological evidence, and the numerous fulfilments of its prophecies ([even in our day!](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/xgurfd/comment/iow5zs3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), these convince or at least strongly persuade us of its reliability.

So there are other ways to establish reliability apart from knowing the author's name. In fact, knowing whether Hebrews was written by someone named Paul or someone named Paula Abdul wouldn't make any difference to me."
ipsxvyy,John-925,xnav4n,"It is 100% true the Bible is the inerrant word of God.

2 Timothy 3:16 - All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness"
ipvjoiu,RaiderRedisthebest,xnav4n,"Because when you are born again the same spirit that lives within the words of the Bible, live within you.

When you love God, you know His love.

You use the spirit of God to discern right from wrong, good from evil.

Since you have a new spirit you will be able to see that old spirit of anger and evil in other people.

We are all born of sin and must overcome the sinful nature and inherit God's nature and be like Him to be able to discern if the stories of the Bible are indeed truth.

I’d been out of work for a month when my previous employer closed with two days warning. I was lucky that a former supervisor landed well and contacted me to come work at their new company.

What if you hire someone who is disfellowshipped, and your current employee refuses to talk with them because of it? What if your current employee refuses to have any contact with the new hire? 

What are you going to do? At that point, his religion is interfering with your company’s bottom line. 

If you don’t understand labor law, I suggest to pay for a few hours time with a labor and employment lawyer so they can walk you through how not to get sued because of your employees. 

Also, if someone chooses to sue, under certain laws, government agencies have to review the situation first before giving permission to sue. Do you want a government investigation?

A labor and employment lawyer will also instruct you on maintaining records required by law."

We undergo thorough training and updates on labor issues.
I am also a member of a HR organization.
You introduced a scenario where religion is unduly affecting workplace operations.

If that were to happen and I became aware of the situation, then it would have to be remedied.

The employee that refuses to talk to the other employee is in the wrong ( generally speaking). There are a few potential actions that can be taken.

But that situation is unlikely to happen. What is more likely to happen is that there could be a prior relationship or interaction that makes it difficult for two people to work together.
But trying to use organization infrastructure to communicate with and send unsolicited information to someone to “attack” their religious beliefs will get the sender in trouble.

If you’re looking for a human, in the flesh, literally named Jesus, he’s obviously not there. If you’re looking for the role he fills, IMO that’s what the entire Old Testament is about. 

Boiling things down a lot, the point of the Old Testament is to show that
1) humanity constantly chooses to define good and evil for itself (instead of trusting God), 

2) God set Israel apart to be a blessing to all the nations and teach them His ways,

3) throughout the history of Israel, they fell short of their calling like all humans do, and 

4) Israel needs to be led by a righteous one who is the greater king, greater priest, and greater prophet than all those before him; the ultimate human, exalted to a place next to God himself, who would call all peoples to himself and bless them if they accept his call.

Jesus outlines the case for his existence in the Old Testament throughout the gospel accounts, and his apostles expounded this further in their subsequent writings. You need not look far to deduce that much of the New Testament is little more than a case for Jesus being the one prophesied in the Old Testament."

is2zs8f,Sea_Cauliflower_1950,y2gfpj,"TLDR: yes, everywhere. You also find Christ’s throne, the cross.

Reading the old testament in the context of Christ is how Christ teaches his disciples to read the Old Testament:

> “And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.”
‭‭Luke‬ ‭24:27‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

Christ, the word of God, makes his first cameo in the first sentences of Genesis, as God creates using his word:

“Then God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light.”
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭1:3‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

First cameo for the cross is not far behind in chapter 3. God describes the Tree of Life as bearing fruit, which if eaten, results in eternal life. This tree also exists in the New Testament, that tree is the cross, and the fruit of the cross is the body of Christ.

> “Then the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and **live forever**”—
‭‭Genesis‬ ‭3:22‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

and in the NT:

>“I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.””
‭‭John‬ ‭6:51‬ ‭NKJV‬‬

is74g1v,Ok-Pain7015,y2gfpj,God in the Old Testament and new is Jehovah
is34w87,rbibleuser,y2gfpj,"Yes, Jesus is in the Old Testament, *by name*!

The name ""Jesus"" is an anglicization of a greco-ization (""Iesou"") of the Aramaic birth-name of Jesus: Yeshua or Yehoshua (ancient Hebrew). There is a book in the Hebrew Scriptures named after Yeshua, called the book of Yehoshua or, in English, Joshua.

The correspondence does not stop there, in fact, the parallelism between Jesus and Joshua is a book-length topic to itself. Moses leads the children of Israel to the promised land but he himself does not cross the Jordan (the river clearly symbolizing death, e.g. 2 Sam. 22:5.) Rather, it is Joshua, the New Moses, who leads the children of Israel into Canaan to conquer it. Likewise, the Covenant of Moses leads the children of Israel to Messiah, but it is Messiah (Jesus) who leads them into the New Heavens and New Earth (Is. 65:17ff, Rev. 21:1ff).

Here is the parallelism in stark contrast:

> The Lord your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy these nations before you, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua also will cross over ahead of you, as the Lord said. (Deuteronomy 31:3)

And:

> Do not let your hearts be troubled. You believe in God; believe also in me. My Father’s house has many rooms; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to **prepare a place** for you? And if I go and **prepare a place** for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. (John 14:1-3)

Yehoshua goes ahead of us to prepare a place for us! (See also: Deut. 9:3, Josh. 3:11, 24:12, Matthew 28:7, Mark 14:28.) And notice that he is there **by name** in the Old Testament. Not merely a passing mention. Not some complex, arcane Bible-code or gematria. Right there on the pages for anyone to see.

Jesus saves!

PS: BibleProject has [great videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dv4-n6OYGI&list=PLH0Szn1yYNecanpQqdixWAm3zHdhY2kPR&index=2&t=1s) explaining how the Gospel of Matthew paints Jesus out as the New Moses (just as Joshua was)... he is, indeed, the prophet spoken of in Deuteronomy 18:15."

These typological parallels can be drawn out by either a person, place, or event or a combination there of. 

Consider Adam being the prefigurment of Christ. Just as Adam lost eternal life for all, Christ restores it; just as Adam was the first man of the old creation (the current age), Christ is the new Adam of the new creation per his glorified body (which was not of this creation). There are other parallels as well that drive home this typological connection even further but this is the gist of it. 

Also, Isaac was an even stronger prefigurement of Christ. Just as Christ offered up himself willingly to the father, so too did Isaac offer himself not only for the sake of his earthly father Abraham, but ultimately for God; just as Isaac carried the wood on his back up the hill (Mount Moriah) that he was to be sacrificed on, so too Jesus carried the wood he would be sacrificed on, up the same hill in fact; two sons (one earthly, one heavenly) to be willingly sacrificed before their fathers. 

Lastly, although there are many more examples of typology, consider Moses who said at his death that there would be a prophet like him (an Israelite) and that the Hebrew people were to be listened to him. Not only are there typological connections that correlate Jesus with Moses, mostly importantly there is the exodus where Moses led the Jews away from the bondage and slavery of Egypt just as Christ leads a new exodus, leading God's faithful away from the bondage and slavery of sin to a heavenly Jeruselum not an earthly one as with Moses. Christ also offers himself as living bread, the new manna of the new exodus. Also, just as a lamb had to be slain before the old Exodus Christ is the Paschal lamb slain before the new exodus began. 

Anyway, these are much deeper aspects to each of these, especially the latter given that we're currently in the midst of the second and final exodus (of the new covenant), but I would strongly consider these connections and parallels that can be drawn out through typology, which the early Church has done most of the legwork on."

The interesting thing is that *Zechariah* is the one having the vision, not Joshua (Yehoshua). And the Angel of the Lord is plainly described to be the coming Messiah. And his earthly name? Jesus (Hebrew, Yehoshua).

is3rpom,chainstorming,y2gfpj,"Speaking of Jericho, there is an interesting point to be had about Rahab’s scarlet cord, which delivered her and her family as a result of her faith. The dye used to generate “scarlet” is made by crushing the tola worm. It was used to dye the temple curtains. It was used for cleansing in Leviticus.

The female Tola worm lays its eggs and affixes itself to an oak tree and dies there, allowing its offspring to feed off of its body. Its body would be crushed in order to create the scarlet thread.

In Psalms 22, the crucified Jesus is referred to as the “tola” or “worm” in verse 6.

I’m sure you can see the parallels— the tola’s body is crushed to create the dye that separates mankind from the holy of holies (you can only approach by passing through the tola curtains… see John 14:6). The tola dye denotes the priests by their robes (they are clothed in tola). The tola is used to cleanse those who had sinned or come in contact with death (Numbers 19:9-11).

The tola affixes itself to the tree to die so that its children may live. Christ affixed himself to the tree to die so that His children may live. It is faith in his blood that saves us from destruction like Rahab. It is through his blood alone that we can enter into the holy of holies. We are set apart and made holy like the priests by the covering of our sin by his blood, much like the levites were clothed in the crimson dye. We are cleansed of sin and death by His blood.

It’s a remarkable point and shouldn’t go unnoticed."

Then Joshua’s battle at the waters of Merom parallel the battle of Armageddon. The imagery in revelation 19 and Joshua 11 are very similar. 
Geographically the winepress and long day are the same and Meggido and Merom are both an invasion from the North country.  They both happen after Joshua and Jesus have already taken the promised land.  And the nations then gather to attack.  Ezekiel 38 has it in detail, when Israel is dwelling securely unwalled. 

There are probably many more parallels to unpack.

Well he wasn't dancing but that's an aside. Usually identifying this figure with Jesus is supported by reading ""he has the appearance of the son of God"", but the actual Aramaic says ""a son of the gods"", i.e. a member of the *bene elohim*. So it seems the figure is actually an angel."

We do not know how the Tetragrammaton יהוה was pronounced. “Yahweh” is nothing but one of several educated guesses that is most commonly cited. In any case, this is a title—not a personal name. If God wanted you to call him by this title he would have had the ancient Jewish scribes preserve the vowel markers so that you could pronounce it properly. The personal name of the God of the Bible (both Old and New Testament) is Jesus. This trend of focusing on the title of יהוה is nothing but a demonically inspired ploy to shift people away from the name of JESUS—the only name that has power over the kingdom of darkness (Acts 4:12; Phil. 2:10).

I personally think it's Yahweh himself. Of course the problem here is that Yahweh says in Exodus 33:20 ""You cannot see my face, for no one shall see me and live."" This isn't a problem for me because I don't think the biblical texts must necessarily agree with one another. Jacob himself says ""I have seen God face to face, yet my life is preserved."" We might also consider Genesis 18:1-15 where he appears to Abraham (and Sarah) and Exodus 24:9-11 where Moses and the elders ""beheld God, and they ate and drank"", though here it's possible they only saw his feet (v. 10).

You will not find this nonsense in any ancient Christian writing that I am aware of, and you most certainly will not find it in the apostolic writings of the New Testament (which quite frankly are all that matter anyway—as the writings of the Church fathers do not always even agree with one another, and are not stamped with the Lamb’s seal of divine authority as are the Holy Scriptures).

No they would not and no it doesn’t.

The man was not God incarnate, but an angel possessing the body of another person for a purpose. Fallen angels possessed humans for no purpose other than to create havoc

In the incarnation, the Word (God) became flesh. The Word was not represented by an angel who then  possessed a human being who already existed.   The baby born to Mary truly was God incarnate."

1. This is God the Father speaking. 
2. He is speaking to Jesus. 
3. He calls Jesus “God” and “Lord.” 
4. He says the heavens and earth were built by Jesus in the beginning.

Man can't see angels otherwise. There is nothing in the Bible that says angels can 'materialize' out of air. So, its my assumption they possessed human hosts to speak with human beings on  occasion. I could be wrong, but it makes sense. Other times angels might appear in a vision like Daniel had, or in  dreams. *""In the past God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets at many times and in various ways,""   Hebrews 1:1*   He spoke thru the prophets and angels were God's  invisible messengers."

is5twg4,AccomplishedAuthor3,y2gfpj,"Demons are fallen angels.

As far as the annunciation, an angel spoke to Joseph in a dream, not when he was awake. Luke mentions  the angel Gabriel speaking to Mary.   Her  speaking to him means he was visible and she spoke to him, which in dreams people rarely did. Whether she assumed he was a man or not isn't written.

In Genesis chapter 18 the three who appear to Abraham are said to be three ""men"". Later its revealed they are three angels. Its not too much of a stretch to put 2 and 2 together and figure God sent angels who then possessed certain men who then went to speak with Abraham and Lot. When its important for man to see the messenger God makes sure His servants will. Angels cannot be seen otherwise as their bodies are invisible to humans. When people see them, its either in a dream when they're asleep, or a vision where they and only they can see it like Daniel did. Otherwise I assume they borrowed a human beings body for however long they needed it."
is5um5l,YCNH,y2gfpj,">Demons are fallen angels.

Not according to the Bible. The closest we come is 1 Enoch, which isn't even canon for the vast majority of Christians, and even it doesn't say fallen angels are demons, rather it says the ghosts of their offspring (nephilim) became evil spirits.

>Later its revealed they are three angels

Just two of them actually, the third is Yahweh according to the text.

This angel possession stuff is just head canon, it's not found in the Bible."

It will probably not help you now but may be food for thought when you get through the dark place you’re in right now. You will get through! The quote:

There’s always a bigger community. For example, a man who, on reaching retirement age and stopping work, quickly loses his vitality and becomes depressed. Abruptly cut off from the company that was his community and bereft of title or profession, he becomes an “ordinary nobody.” As he is unable to accept the fact that he is now “normal,” he becomes old practically overnight. But all that really happened to the man is that he was cut off from the small community that is his company. Each person belongs to a separate community. And when it comes down to it, all of us belong to the community of the earth, and the community of the universe.

I would like you to gain the awareness that you belong to a separate, larger community that is beyond the one you see in your immediate vicinity—for example, the country or local society in which you live —and that you are contributing in some way within that community.

It’s possible that with regard to the community that is your [congregation], you won’t have that “It’s okay to be here” sense of belonging. When that happens, if you are thinking of [the congregation] as being everything to you, you will end up without a sense of belonging to anything. And then, you will escape within a smaller community, such as your home.

Once you know how big the world is, you will see that all the hardship you went through in [the congregation] was a storm in a teacup. The moment you leave the teacup, that raging storm will be gone, and a gentle breeze will greet you in its place.

When we run into difficulties in our interpersonal relations, or when we can no longer see a way out, what we should consider first and foremost is the principle that says, “Listen to the voice of the larger community.”"

From as recent as 1882 until today, more than 175 Bible prophecies have been fulfilled, *in our time*, including:

* the first organised mass return of the Jews to Palestine in 1882, with more following,
* the purchase of land at inflated prices
* resettlement of Jews in very specific areas foretold in the Bible (although there were various other options availed by the United Nations),
* the founding of the state of Israel in one literal day on 14 May 1948 (and no, we are not saying that a day is 1,000 years here) (Is. 66:8),
* the incredible military success and preservation of a tiny country surrounded by hostile nations determined to obliterate it from the map,
* the founding of the Arab League whose sole objective was to destroy Israel,
* the identities of the six founding members of the Arab League -- to that level of detail!
* the Arab-Israeli Six-Day-War in June 1967, when Israel stunned the world and defied all odds to win the war and even enlarge its territory further, taking control of the old city of Jerusalem including the Temple Mount, along with the rest of East Jerusalem,
* the conquest and recovery of Mount Zion (Ps. 126),
* the re-cultivation of grapes (for wine), exotic fruits and flowers in a wasteland decimated by centuries of Muslim rule (the Muslims were teetotallers and had destroyed all vines),
* the revival of Hebrew which had become a dead language after more than a thousand years since the loss of Jewish statehood in AD125 (no other dead language e.g. Sanskrit, Latin, etc. has ever been revived in like manner),
* Saddam Hussein and the defeat of Iraq,
* the revived Roman empire,
* global pestilences and pandemics,
* wars on an unprecedented global scale (two world wars in the 20th century alone!),
* terrorist activity previously unheard of,
* and many more.

After centuries of relative quietness in the area of prophetic fulfilment since AD70, the world has since 1882 seen a sudden rapid and unprecedented increase in the rate of fulfilment of Bible prophecy.

Prophecy fulfilled by people and peoples who don't know God, don't care about God, and obviously have no vested interest in making Bible prophecy come true. Current affairs explained by ancient prophecy. Sheer coincidence? What's the mathematical probability?  You be the judge."

it2nogz,Rbrtwllms,y8u3u2,"The Last Days in the Bible are the days in which God's judgement comes down (namely on Israel). During the First Temple's destruction, the Israelites understood that was judgement on them, however, that was not the ""final"" judgement. The same prophets that spoke of God's judgement and their later being freed from their captivity spoke of a later judgement (""last days""):

One example of this is Daniel:

Daniel 9:25‭-‬27—*“Know and understand this: From the time the word goes out to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the Anointed One, the ruler, comes, there will be seven ‘sevens,’ and sixty-two ‘sevens.’ It will be rebuilt with streets and a trench, but in times of trouble.* **After the sixty-two ‘sevens,’ the Anointed One will be put to death and will have nothing. The people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary. The end will come like a flood: War will continue until the end, and desolations have been decreed.** *He will confirm a covenant with many for one ‘seven.’ In the middle of the ‘seven’ he will put an end to sacrifice and offering. And at the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation, until the end that is decreed is poured out on him.”*

Jesus added to this prophecy in Matt 24, and other Gospel passages (please read the full chapter, I just picked out some verses for brevity):

Matthew 24:1‭-‬3‭, ‬15‭-‬16‭, ‬22—*Jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings.* **“Do you see all these things?” he asked. “Truly I tell you, not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”** *As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately. “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen, and what will be the sign of your coming and of* **the end of the age**?”.... **So when you see standing in the holy place ‘the abomination that causes desolation,’ spoken of through the prophet Daniel**—*let the reader understand— then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.... “If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.*
 

This was speaking of the Temple's destruction in 70 AD and the Jewish Diaspora.

Here are other verses from the NT that show that the authors understood that they were in or nearing the ""last days"" (there are many OT ones that speak of these future events):


1 Peter 4:17—**For the time has come for judgment, and it must begin with God’s household**. *And if judgment begins with us, what terrible fate awaits those who have never obeyed God’s Good News?*

1 John 2:18
*Dear children,* **THE LAST HOUR IS HERE**. *You have heard that the Antichrist is coming, and already many such antichrists have appeared. From this we know that* **THE LAST HOUR HAS COME.**

Acts of the Apostles 2:15-‬18 (compare to Joel 2: 28-32)—*These people are not drunk, as some of you are assuming. Nine o’clock in the morning is much too early for that. No, what you see was predicted long ago by the prophet Joel:* ‘**In the last days**,’*God says, ‘I will pour out my Spirit upon all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams. In those days I will pour out my Spirit even on my servants—men and women alike— and they will prophesy.*

Revelation 22:10—*Then he instructed me,* **“Do not seal up the prophetic words in this book, for the time is near.**

Compare the Rev 22:10 with this:

Daniel 12:4—*But you, Daniel, keep this prophecy a secret;* **seal up the book until the time of the end,** *when many will rush here and there, and knowledge will increase.”*

This shows that for Daniel the time of the end was many years away (this was about 500 years before Christ came), whereas in Revelation it was close. If the ""End"" or ""Last Days"" in Revelation we're referring to today, that would be about 2000 years later. This is 4 times longer than Daniel's ""waiting period"". 

Lastly, just for the sake of adding a non-biblical source into the mix, the Jewish historian Josephus, when writing about the Second Temple's destruction, also recognized that the events were a fulfillment of Daniel's (and other OT prophet's) prophecies:

*(109)* **And who is there that does not know what the writings of the ancientprophets contain in them,—and particularly that oracle whichis just now going to be fulfilled upon this miserable city**—for they foretold that this city shouldbe then taken when somebody shall begin the slaughter of his own countrymen!(110) And arenot both the city and the entire temple now full of the dead bodies of your countrymen? It isGod therefore, it is God himself who is bringing on this fire,* **to purge that city and temple by
means of the Romans.**

So, yes, we now are in the last days, as were Paul and every other apostle.

it3jyxl,AccomplishedAuthor3,y8u3u2,"I agree, its amazing!  The best sign of Christ's second coming wasn't wars, earthquakes and pestilence, but  the return of the Jews to Palestine. No one knows how long they will be in Israel before Jesus returns, but the fact that they are back in Israel is stunning and it makes the impossible possible since the last century

How else could Jesus 'the King of the Jews' sit on David's throne unless David's throne was back where it always had been, in Israel? **Luke 1:32**   For centuries this was never even a possibility as the Jews had been dispersed from 70 AD on. No temple. No Jewish Kingdom and no throne.  Jesus disciples asked Him if he was restoring the Kingdom to Israel and at the time there was still an Israel to restore a Kingdom to. Jesus foretold that the temple would be destroyed, but He never said how long it wouldn't be there. Jesus also told His disciples  it wasn't for them to know---not if the Kingdom would be restored, but it wasn't for them to know when it would be restored.    **Acts 1:7**    Of course when it actually happened they would know.  This is why the destruction of the temple and the city of Jerusalem must have been quite a paradox for early Christians. They had to wonder, ""now what?""  Even though Jesus told them the temple would be destroyed, as years turned into decades and decades into centuries the whole idea of Israel and her Kingdom being restored was forgotten or spiritualized.

For a good many centuries the church assumed a role as spiritual Israel and that she is. There is a spiritual and there is also a  physical Israel of God.  People say God rejected His people when Rome destroyed Jerusalem and the temple, but God restored the Jews back to Israel twice before, why wouldn't He do it again? Paul wrote that God's promises are irrevocable.  It was the height of arrogance to assume God would never  bring His chosen people back, because He did it before.

I believe Jesus will come back in the flesh and fulfill the  prophecy recorded in Luke 1:32  and He will sit on David's throne, along with many other prophecies as recorded by the prophet Isaiah and all the other prophets."

Walter Martin has a good study but the topic is so in-depth he misses a little."
it3a7b4,JasonBourne008,y8u3u2,"I had not heard of **Walter Ralston Martin**, but it is disappointing to see that he was divorced twice and married three times. That is not living in accordance with the Word of God. Otherwise, it seems his life was largely controversy free and his work on exposing cults detailed.

In Matthew 24:14 the ""***Gospel of the Kingdom***"" that will be preached in all the world is not the same as the ""gospel"" being preached today. The gospel of the kingdom was preached by John the Baptist and Jesus Christ during the early years of his ministry, up until the time when John the Baptist was arrested and beheaded. The gospel of the kingdom is looking forward to a time when the Messiah will reign over Israel in righteousness. Once John the Baptist was arrested Jesus transitions from dealing with the nation of Israel to dealing with individuals - from the gospel of the kingdom to the **gospel of God**. If you think about it the contemporary gospel message has already been preached in all the world - that would make the prophesy complete. However, it is important to note that it specifies the gospel of the kingdom as a witness to nations, not individuals, but nations. this is clearly not the same gospel of Christ's sacrifice on the cross for our sins that we preach today.

Matthew 24:5 to 24:14 is talking about the ""*beginning of sorrows*"", or the first 3.5 years of tribulation, or the first half of the 70th week of Daniel. Although today we certainly see many of the events listed in that portion of scripture it is my understanding that they will be orders of magnitudes worse in the great tribulation period (false teachers, wars, earthquakes, famines, pestilence).

As you have identified verse 15 of Matthew 24 with the ""**abomination that causes desolation**"" is a critical verse in this chapter. This verse which marks the change from the first half of the tribulation to the second half - which will be even worse than the first half of the great tribulation (verses 16-28). This is Jacob’s Trouble."

If the Bible doesn't say, there is no way to know for sure, and any assertion would merely be speculation. This sort of thing is unknowable apart from revealed knowledge, and the Bible hasn't revealed what Satan said to them.

However, if their motives are at all like what Satan's motives were, perhaps Ezekiel 28:11-19 may shed some light on it:

# [Ezekiel 28:11-19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ezek+28%3A11-19&version=ESV)"
isjvnz4,HoneyWest55,y4xz3i,They have free will too.  Why did thousands of people witness Christ Jesus' miracles and only a small part of them became loyal disciples and others plotted his death?  Some are righteously disposed-some have wicked hearts.  God never forced anyone to do anything.  We all get to choose.  Even the angels.  Adam and Eve chose.  Micheal/Jesus chose.  Satan chose.
ishhu0n,Truthspeaks111,y4xz3i,"My guess would be that we're talking about a split in the church (the stars of heaven) where 1/3 of the church is convinced by the father of lies to interpret the gospel in another way and create a schism in the church. A rebellion. 

In the book of Daniel, the goat with a notable horn wars against a ram with two horns one taller than the other and the taller horn came up last. 

In the book of Luke, there's a great betrayal of the followers of Jesus that takes place in the last days which results in the trampling down of Jerusalem (the Holy city) by the Gentiles (the goat with a notable horn - the horn could be the portion of the church that's rebelled and run after another gospel - progressive Christianity perhaps)). 

Daniel 8:3 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had [two] horns: and the [two] horns [were] high; but one [was] higher than the other, and the higher came up last.
8:4 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither [was there any] that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.
8:5 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the West on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat [had] a notable horn between his eyes.
8:6 And he came to the ram that had [two] horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his power.
8:7 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.

The ram I could see being symbolic for a group that is seen by others as being a bully of sorts (Christians/Catholics). The two horns on the ram could refer to two factions - one came up first (Catholics have been around since the beginning and Evangelicals have been more politically vocal (the higher horn that came up last)).  

Luke 21:15 For I will give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay nor resist.
21:16 **And ye shall be betrayed** both by parents, and brethren, and kinsfolks, and friends; and [some] of you shall they cause to be put to death.

isgvov2,Imaginary_Athlete_56,y4xz3i,"Your claims are inclusive of scripture however you then go beyond what is written and impose your own ideas. 

For example- you state that the Tower of Babel was an attempt by man to “crack through the firmament.”

No where in scripture is this said, no where. 

You say that “even the ancients understood that the earth was a flat disc” however the Bible says in Isaiah 40:22 clearly describes the Earth (not a firmament) as a globe. 

I mean some of the things you said were interesting. 

But overall s as soon as you step outside of the Bible and impose your own thoughts then I cannot go with you on your journey away from truth. 

Finally, we are no longer living in a time of miracles. The Bible has been given to us to lead us. It is all we need. 

Your visions, which clearly step away from the Bible are perhaps something you should think deeply about because as we all know Satan transforms himself into an Angel of light. It’s likely he is using you to further confuse people. I mean talking about portals? This is absolutely no where in scripture. 

Please be careful and reject any such visions.

I placed you; you were on the holy mountain of God;  
in the midst of the stones of fire you walked.  
^(15) You were blameless in your ways  
from the day you were created,  
till unrighteousness was found in you.  
^(16) In the abundance of your trade  
you were filled with violence in your midst, and you sinned;  
so I cast you as a profane thing from the mountain of God,  
and I destroyed you, **O guardian cherub**,

iq8ol9h,GMgoddess,xq6dil,"Let’s consider this logically. If you believe Satan is real, do you believe he’s blinding the minds of the witnesses to keep them from God? If they are kept from God, does that mean they will be punished by him/lose salvation because of it? 

Cults use what is known as “undue influence” to keep people in. Some who are born in never escape because they quite literally have never been given the necessary resources to learn critical thinking. Their free will has been ripped from them, so how does it make sense for God to judge them harshly when they really don’t know any better? 

Or, if is Satan blinding their minds, does that mean Satan is more powerful than God, or perhaps draws people away from God at a faster rate than God draws people to himself? I think we can agree that there are many good JWs, but that they are very misguided. Do they not deserve salvation because of being convinced of something untrue due to Satan’s influence, even though God didn’t intervene? 

As someone else said, I’d love to see what reasoning/logic/evidence you have that has convinced you that Satan is anything more than allegory."

As another example of this fallacy, you could say that if a room is dark, the lamp is broken. The lamp *may* be broken, but the room being dark doesn’t necessarily mean it is. It’s just one out of various possibilities.

it9hof4,Imperfect_Disciple,ya56jr,Satan was created a spirit creature to reside in heaven. He already had access to heaven and God. The Bible does describe a time when he will no longer have access. We are not spirit creature trying to be challenger Gods to Yahweh. Personally you and I have never been perfect and fallen away to pursue sin. I can think of several reasons why our relationship with God is different then that of Satans. God promises a direct relationship with him once more after this whole Satan and sin thing is done. I kinda look forward to talking to him as Adam once did.
it9cczt,JeeringIsland,ya56jr,While it is a fascinating question (I’ll certainly give you that!) I don’t think a response to it would change the intent of the author of Job.
it9xrwn,Aditeuri,ya56jr,"Almost like humans and angels aren’t the same lol. Even after the resurrection, humans will be made greater than the angels and empowered with judgment over them."
it9ksh5,rbibleuser,ya56jr,"We have to take care not to allow theological language to ""get in the way"" of the text. The theology helps us understand the text better, especially with respect to ""the big picture"". But it can also lead to over-simplifications that end up as cartoonish caricatures of the text that wholly fail to grasp even the most basic meaning of the text, as its first readers would have understood it.

Often, catechitic doctrines are stated without justification beyond some references to the text. They are true as far as they go, but we have to be careful to avoid rephrasing the Bible in our own words, and then asking ""why is it this way?"" God is not an automaton, some kind of reflexive being who is incapable of understanding his creation, on its own terms. God knows what it is to be human, he knows what sin is, he knows what temptation is, he knows the ""pull"" or ""draw"" of sin, and so on. So, the unapproachability of God is not about some magical aversion which God has to sin, like some kind of involuntary divine gag-reflex, rather, it's about the fall of humanity from the position of privilege to which he was originally stationed, see Gen. 1:28 and parallel passages.

I find that the medieval royal court is often a great picture of the heavens -- if God is the king, then Adam was once a prince in God's court. After disobeying his Father, Adam fell from grace and was driven from the court. Is there some magical force-field which would cause a king to be involuntarily repulsed by his disobedient and rebellious son or, vice-versa, which would involuntarily cause flames to shoot out from the king and burn up his son?! No, of course not. Nevertheless, the disobedient son *cannot approach the king* by virtue of what he has done (rebellion).

When we reason artificially about the text, we can lose sight of what it's actually talking about. Extending the royal court metaphor, Satan was a noble in God's court whose rebellion was exposed, and he was hurled out of the court. When his son disobeyed, God's heart was grieved and he determined to provide salvation. But when his rebellious noble disobeyed, God had no reason to spare him and determined to destroy him. Satan's time on earth is purely probationary. From God's standpoint, this world-age is simply the murder trial of Satan, who is on trial for the murder of Adam and Eve, at least, those descendants of Adam and Eve who repent of sin and find refuge in Jesus Christ. Satan is dragging all of this on and on out of an attempt to finish the rebellion he started (thus mooting his trial). That's why he murdered the *obedient* Son of God, thus proving that his intentions all along were murder (John 8:44).

As a celestial being, Satan is able to appear before God at the appointed times. That's when Job 1 happens. But he does not have some kind of unrestricted access to God, and the only purpose for which God continues to permit him to appear is in order to complete his legal condemnation and sentencing to eternal fire. We, however, do have unrestricted access through the obedient Son of God, that is, Jesus Christ. So, unlike Satan, we are able to ""boldly enter"" into the throne-room of God, and we are encouraged to use that power in the New Testament."
it9ffh9,nickshattell,ya56jr,"In brief - as you can see, for example, in Job - (the time before the Mediator) Job's suffering seems to be in vain, and the lack of a mediator does nothing to alleviate Job's fear of being in sin (even though he was righteous, his ""own clothes"" abhor him - Job 9:29-35);

>*If I am condemned, why then do I labor in vain? If I wash myself with snow water, and cleanse my hands with soap, yet you will plunge me into the pit, and my own clothes will abhor me. For He is not a man, as I am, that I may answer Him, and that we should go to court together. Nor is there any mediator between us, who may lay his hand on us both. Let Him take His rod away from me, and do not let dread of Him terrify me. Then I would speak and not fear Him, but it is not so with me.*

Additionally, the young Elihu gives us insight as to how the fear and pain of physical death causes us to draw near the pit, and how a Mediator would help redeem us (Job 33:19-28);

>*Man is also chastened with pain on his bed, and with strong pain in many of his bones, so that his life abhors bread, and his soul succulent food. His flesh wastes away from sight, and his bones stick out which once were not seen. Yes, his soul draws near the Pit, and his life to the executioners. If there is a messenger for him, a mediator, one among a thousand, to show man His uprightness, then He is gracious to him, and says, ‘Deliver him from going down to the Pit; I have found a ransom’; His flesh shall be young like a child’s, He shall return to the days of his youth. He shall pray to God, and He will delight in him, He shall see His face with joy, For He restores to man His righteousness. Then he looks at men and says, ‘I have sinned, and perverted what was right, and it did not profit me.’ He will redeem his soul from going down to the Pit, and his life shall see the light.*

And as you can see, when Jesus comes, He resists all temptations from the Tempter (Matthew 4, Luke 4) - in other words, He does not reach out to take from the Tree of Knowledge and is thereby granted the Tree of Life. Jesus drives ""the prince of this world"" out (John 12:31)."

They believe this because they think of God as so overly severe he can't even have anything to do with a tiny new born infant as if God sees an infant as no different than a mass murderer of millions. Btw over severity = punishing the innocent which is called bearing false witness to a persons state and circumstances, because its not according to the truth of the matter. 

Christ was the exact representation of the Father and He ate and fellowshipped with sinners. It was his whole message... to deliver them from their slavery to sins, not to punish them for being slaves. To really deliver them. Not some fake role playing unreal imputation where God pretends you are Christ and Christ pretends to be you. But true deliverance in which His people actually are delivered and actually do become a righteous people (""reconciliation"").

A lot of people's definition of ""going by the bible"" is taking verses out of context and misinterpreting scripture. They see what isn't there and don't see what is there. But even biblical interpretations are subject to the truth."

it9h5oi,JeeringIsland,ya56jr,Fair enough! It’s definitely an intriguing question. I’ll be curious to see what thoughts others will have.
ita825d,nickshattell,ya56jr,"We can talk to God through His Divine Human who is called the Son. If it is written that Satan talked to God, it is written this way for you to understand larger concepts of Heaven and Hell (ie good and evil). All things of Heaven and Earth and Hell are underneath God, or in God’s plain view, so to speak. If it is written that Satan was permitted to talk to God, then it is for the sake of the witness (The Holy Scriptures) which one can learn from. Furthermore, “Satan” is invisible or spiritual in nature and is only manifested in the world through human-flesh cooperation with the falsities and evils that are adversarial to truth and good. God is Spirit (John 4:24), God is Good itself (Mark 10:18) and Truth itself (John 14:6). “Satan” is a Hebrew word meaning “Adversary” or “satan” meaning “a/an adversary”."
ita9m3u,nickshattell,ya56jr,"I apologize for the additional comment, but I wanted to add some Scripture to show you that we can talk to God through the Son;

(from John 14);

*Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.”*

*Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works. Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the sake of the works themselves.""*

(from Colossians 1 and 2);

*He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation. For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him.*

*For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; and you are complete in Him, who is the head of all principality and power.*

(from John 1);

*No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has made Him known.*

(from John 15);

*No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you.*

(from Matthew 27 and Luke 10);

*All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him.*

I add these truths in because as the other Scriptures show above, before God Glorified His Name in the Son (before the time of the Mediator), no one could really approach God, or understand God - hence Job's words in agony *""For He is not a man, as I am, that I may answer Him, and that we should go to court together. Nor is there any mediator between us, who may lay his hand on us both.""* But because of the set-apart Gospel witness, we are able to witness to the Father in the visible form of His Person, something that all human beings can see and know and come to examine themselves against (i.e. come to repentance and be saved). This is also more completely understood when the whole of the covenant (Moses and the Prophets) is known and understood - as is witnessed to by many examples in the Gospel Scriptures as well as Paul and Apollos themselves who taught the truth of the Gospel from the *Hebrew* Scriptures (i.e. the Son reveals the Father)."

itagrb2,Imaginary_Athlete_56,ya56jr,"Yes absolutely I understand that Jesus is my mediator… thank you for your thoughtful response. 

Why doesn’t Satan need a mediator to talk to god?"
itaiux6,nickshattell,ya56jr,"I’m pretty sure the only place you will find “Satan” openly conversing with God is in the book of Job, hence the emphasis on it being before the time of the Mediator (as the Scriptures in Job show). It is easy to form many speculations from these few passages. Your question seems to be rooted in your own understanding of Satan, etc., so it is hard for me to give you the direct answer you desire. For starters, we are human, alive in the flesh, satan is not. Second, if it is written that Satan spoke to God it is because God permitted it (not because Satan can freely approach God). Third, even before the mediator, all human beings could still freely speak to God, and God permits those to be heard whom He will hear (Moses, for example, who was given to receive the covenant and the pattern of the Tabernacle). These are just a few reasons why your question doesn’t even really make sense."

iqp1q0r,Sweet_Manufacturer_1,xsdqqi,The spirit is love I think and joy and peace…. The truth (doctrinally).  I am still working that out…. But I know the governing body is a group of men not anointed or chosen by God….not any more human than anyone …Why do we die why are we here why do greedy unscrupulous manipulative psychos insist that jesus chose them and they speak for God?  I personally believe now after knowing all the lies I was forced to listen to and all the hurt and all the insanity which is all valid…. That the golden rule is still golden that the basic Christian faith is still true….That we were created…. By God…. To love and be loved….I see too much intelligence and beauty and bittersweet experience behind all that is around me…..Whatever his name is….I’m  not sure I don’t really care…clearly something went terribly wrong….look around life is full of difficulty sin is real…..there is evil in the world…. People some people that are not Jehovah’s witnesses do far worse things than they do…. Some do far better…..Jesus came to fix it and that to live life with  love for God and for others is better than to be absolutely with no moral compass…. I see no legitimate argument that the earth will forever be a place that is divided by different governments….nationalities religions and specific interpretations of the Bible…. Certainly God will intervene at some point….So on some accounts I agree with JWs on many accounts I cannot…. How can I pretend to believe the rants of 8 men in New York who wouldn’t dare say sorry or we were wrong…. Or we don’t know or we’re not anointed or a plethora of things that are clearly just not true….. On what planet is it ever going to be true that they are Gods visible representatives on earth…..?   They know they aren’t they are terrified of YouTube and honest criticism of a religion started in the 19th century that has hurt so many people and refuses to admit or acknowledge anything honestly….and then say we have the “truth.”  I am grateful I was raised with some love…..and respect for God….but that was contingent on obeying an organization that has predicted the end of the world and proven to be wrong…..been quite proud hypocritical and self righteous and complicit in all sorts of stupidity….. I too am just a man doing the best I can…. Do I long for a world where there will be peace and justice for all?  Of course…. Do I think that JWs have it all figured out…. Of course not…. Does anyone??? After examining different  religions from Hindus to Buddhists to atheism and all that I have considered…. I still believe Jesus was right…. Love God and your neighbor don’t judge it isn’t your job….a man and a woman still makes a family….and work take care of your family have lots of passionate sex with your wife or husband drink eat and enjoy life….. when Jesus does return I’m pretty sure we will all be wrong and right about a lot of things….I think in the end we all want to be happy….to live a life that is free of pain and suffering….. to have friends…. Food clothing shelter good health and discover our talents and develop them and explore this earth….if this is all there is…. illogical to me….no one knows it all…. I don’t and I can’t knock on peoples doors telling people….that I do….and tell them beards are the devil education is the devil…. Just wash windows and wait for the end….and don’t you dare drink that wine and eat the bread that’s for “special” people…. Neither can I believe in hell or the trinity….When we were born I’m pretty sure before we were subjected to this insanely difficult yet beautiful experience we were all special and we are all still forgivable and precious to God even though we may hate him…. Or question his existence….or deny him completely….I think his heart can take it….. if he or she or both is whatever he says he is….Jesus still makes a lot more sense to me than anything I have ever known…. I know of know other answer to the big questions that satisfies my curiosity and fears….Love is better than hate kindness and forgiveness is better than cruelty and resentment…. When the time comes and I face God I hope he is merciful to me…..In the meantime I’m going to love everyone around me and believe that someone made the sunset puppy dogs and children…. The world is not what it will be in the future and I hope someday heaven and earth will be in harmony…. That’s all I know….
iqkeelc,IndepndentThinkr,xsdqqi,"Perhaps it would be helpful to determine what resonates from *within: t*rusting your inner core.

There is truth to the words ""seek and you shall find"". When a person seeks sincerely for what is true, they are opening a way to determine what resonates within. The important part is not discounting when something does.

As JW's we were trained to not think for ourselves and to ignore that which resonates from within when it conflicted with doctrine. Now that you do not have doctrine hanging over your head, you ARE free to explore this."

I started out thinking it was just the org that was apostate, but the Bible and Jehovah were still there to guide me. Then after more research I even started to doubt the Bible, Christianity, now I'm even wondering who is ""Jehovah"", really? 

This our deconstruction, unlearning, relearning period and if there is a higher power, which I think there is, ""he"" is just, merciful and compassionate and he completely understands the predicament we are in. In order to truly worship in ""spirit and truth"" the first step is to find out what that actually is... keep seeking, keep searching, keep praying, keep an open mind, show unconditional love, be authentic, and you will be led. Be gentle with yourself. Take your time, one day at a time, breathe fresh air, meditate on creation. I have found that this positive energy / mindset is really conducive to my journey."

isngmd9,Ihatecensorship395,y65aqc,"The quickest way to lose family or friends is to loan them money. JW'S are notorious for ""borrowing"" money that they have no ability or intention of paying back.

I have always said, if you want to do something for someone who is in need, figure out an amount that you won't miss and won't cause a hardship for you if you never see it again. Then gift that amount.

If you were thinking of loaning them $500 but you really need it back, it would be better to gift them $50. Then there's no hard feelings on either side.

Aside from that, it sounds as if your politics are aligned differently.  Maybe look for some other friends."
isnur6e,FloridaSpam,y65aqc,"How much time between accident and gift. Maybe they are busy recovering. You get what you give, sometimes you don't.

isnzand,daylily61,y65aqc,"It's very possible that your friends' perceived avoidance of you really has nothing to do with you personally.

You said that this couple were not well off, AND that the husband was recently in a car accident.  They may be feeling ashamed that they so badly needed the money you gave them.  OR maybe their home is not as orderly as they usually keep it, because the accident has made it much harder for them to keep it up. 

These are just possible reasons why they appear to be avoiding you.  Another possibility is that now you know their political views are so different from yours, they may be wondering if you still want to be friends with them.

This is a situation where the quality of EMPATHY is key.  Put yourself in this couple's shoes, and try to imagine how you would be feeling and behaving in the same circumstances.

Nevertheless, the only way to know for sure is to TALK to them.  Of course you don't want to be phoning them and asking ""Are you dumping me?"" or whining ""I thought we were friends, why haven't you called me??"" 😢

So I suggest this instead.  Call them, like any concerned friend would, and ask how they're doing?  Do they need anything??   Mention that since you'd heard so little from them lately, that you felt you ought to check on them, and make sure everything was okay.

Now, to do this means you will be approaching them in a tactful, NON-THREATENING WAY.  The ball will be in their court, and THEIR RESPONSES TO YOUR REACHING OUT TO THEM will give you some idea of why they have reduced contact with you.  Take it from there 🙂"

Now, I knew that I was not then as close with my sister-in-law as I am now, so I figured she probably didn't think of me. In the years I HAVE been close to her she's not had a Halloween party once. But it did always kind nag at me as to why wasn't I ever invited. I finally asked her. She's NEVER had a Halloween party.

Those who truly believe and try to imitate Jesus. They’re a very small minority. 

Those who were brought up going to church, and it’s expected by their family and community, so they continue to attend. They often have financial relationships with other church members. They usually believe in God, but he’s just a fuzzy concept. Probably a simple majority. 

Those who go to church because of family and community, as above, but don’t really believe. They limit their Christian behavior to their family and friends. They will lie and steal and cheat even other members of their church. And if you’re not in their church, prepare to be ripped off, lied about, abused, etc. They often take over churches, and end up running everything. They will drive out anyone who doesn’t fall in line. An extremely large minority.

The LORD has your back, and will ultimately defend you.
Work sabotage:

My ride share to a certain job was moving away, and I put in for a different position at the company. Took the required test, passed. I was supposed to wait for a phone call at a specific time. It did not come.
I drove down to the company, and found that I seemed erased.?????
The young man at the desk gave me a phone number. I called it.

It goes something like this...
middle person to top, top to middle person, middle person back to you. Takes a while. A mistake: phone number directly to the top. The gentleman marveled, because, apparently, that's never happened before, and I couldn't pin down the number giver (shift change?) and I then asked, since I had him on the horn, if I could state my case (so I don't waste both our time), and he agreed.

I could give him names, dates, times, when I took the test, all of it!!! He put me on hold, and began calling around...RIGHT THEN.
When he got back to me, he could confirm ALL OF IT!!! The open position went to someone else, but I could still work in the department!!!!YAY.
SOMEONE hacked out all of the other information, and put in that I had quit for personal reasons. The guy on the other end of the phone asked if I knew of who would do such a thing. I had my suspicions, but I just wanted to get back to work. No ill will, no problem.

As it was a seasonal job, after the season (though it runs fairly all year 'round) the seasonal were laid off. I was not. I was a keeper!!!!
If there had not been bankruptcy issues, I'd still be there today. They resolved the problems later, and are still open. TRUE STORY 
The happy ""accident"" wasn't. PRAISE THE LORD!!!!"

iru2dhj,truth-always-matters,y0u2o0,"People always debate over the term ""rapture"" and I'm not sure what their point is.  Harpazo is the term used when the bride meets Jesus up in the clouds. It's a ""lifting up"" or ""caught up"" ""taken with force"" or ""rapture"" and they all represent the same concept. If readers understand that the wedding is separate than the actual second coming, that's what is being spoken about. If the reader would also understand that the typical wedding feasts take place over 7 days,  they'd understand that also represents the 7 year tribulation happening on earth concurrently. When Jesus calls His bride up (those dead in Him and then those alive in Him),  He doesn't come down. His bride is lifted up into the prepared wedding chamber and the wedding will take place. Jesus returns for the second coming at the end of tribulation and that is when satan will be thrown into the lake of fire with the false prophet. The end times prophecy is parallel to the Jewish wedding. A groom goes and prepares a place for he and his bride. During this time the bride is preparing and ensuring they have oil for their lamps and the necessary things to sustain. When the groom's father says the chamber is prepared, he can then return to collect his bride.

These are the parables Jesus spoke about, keeping your lamp and oil full(faith and spirit in Him) and that His Father will send Him for His bride when the wedding chamber is ready. When He returns we must be certain we are ready for Him as we don't know the exact hour.

It's a beautiful parable that many miss because they do not understand. The rapture better called the harpazo will happen before the AC is announced. Just be sure you're ready and not letting the world deceive you or cause you to lose your light.  ❤🙏🙏🙏"
iruh1d8,snoweric,y0u2o0,"I would say ""no.""  Your question raises a key, and hotly disputed, area of eschatology (the Biblical study of end times events).  Will the rapture/translation of the saints occur at the beginning of the great tribulation, in the middle, or at the end, as Jesus returns.  Whatever answer is accepted will have a major effect on how someone outlines end time events.

  
Here I will maintain that there will be no rapture to heaven before the great tribulation occurs for Christians.  Since this may be a minority position among fundamentalist Protestants who take the Bible seriously and interpret its end time events in a more literal, premillennialist sense, I will spend some time explaining why I believe this here.  For at least a few decades now, there have been three standard positions debated among conservative Protestant Christians about Jesus' return:  1.  The pre-tribulation rapture view, which says Christians go to heaven seven years before Jesus' publicly visible return, so that they are protected during the great tribulation.  2.  The mid-tribulation rapture view, which says Christians go to heaven half way through the great tribulation (i.e., 3 1/2 years in).  3.  The post-tribulation view, which maintains the translation/""rapture"" occurs after the great tribulation, just as Jesus' return occurs.  I will make the case for the post-tribulation view in this email, which means I'm opposed to the views promoted by Hal Lindsey, of ""Last Great Planet Earth"" fame and the more recent ""Left Behind"" contemporary Christian novel series.     
First of all, it has to be realized the secret rapture theory effectively says Jesus returns twice within a period of 3 1/2 or (much more commonly) 7 years.  One of His returns will be later and publicly observable, the other secret and unseen except by the raptured Christians who will suddenly disappear without warning from the earth.  But does Scripture really teach this?  Or does the idea that some texts teach a secret, unnoticed return have to be read into them?  For example, the moment the last trumpet sounds (that is, the seventh of the seven trumpets mentioned in Rev. 8:2, which announces Jesus' return in Rev. 11:15-18), Paul says we Christians will be transformed into having immortality:  ""Behold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we shall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet; for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.  For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality"" (I Cor. 15:51-53).  Since a trumpet sounds, it's hard to believe this occurs quietly, and the world doesn't notice what's going on.   

  
Similarly, when Jesus returns, He inflicts then, and not (say) seven years later the penalty upon the world for its disobedience and disbelief:  ""... when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in flaming fire, dealing out tribulation to those who do not know God and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.  And these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, when He comes to be glorified in His saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed . . ."" (II Thess. 1:7-9).  It's hard to see how there can be flaming fire and tribulation dealt out by Jesus' return without it also being publicly observable at the time.     
Jesus, in the Olivet prophecy, taught that His return would be publicly observable, not something easily missed, by comparing it to a huge lightning strike:  ""If therefore they say to you, 'Behold, He is in the wilderness,' do not go forth, or 'Behold, He is in the inner rooms,' do not believe them.  For just as the lightning comes from the east, and flashes even to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be"" (Matt. 24:26-27).   
One of the classic texts cited for the rapture view is I Thess. 4:14-17.  But does it really support this teaching?  Or does it have to be read into this text?  Notice that there's no indication the events described are secret and unnoticed by the world:  ""For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God \[i.e., lots of noise-making activities!--EVS\]; and the dead in Christ shall rise first.  Then we who are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds \[i.e., where 747's fly every day in the sky, not the third heaven of God's throne--EVS\] to meet the Lord in the air \[i.e., the atmosphere\], and thus we shall always be with the Lord"" (verses 16-17).  Notice that the resurrection of Christian who had died in previous centuries occurs at the same time as Jesus' return, not just the translation/glorification of the saints still alive and on the earth at the time.     
Where does the text (in I Thess. 4:14-17) say Jesus then returns to heaven?  It doesn't!  Zechariah 14:3-4 teaches that when the Lord returns and wages war, He lands on earth right near Jerusalem, on the Mount of Olives:  ""Then the Lord will go forth and fight against those nations, as when He fights on a day of battle.  And in that day His feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, which is in front of Jerusalem on the east . . .""  Why should we suppose there is a 7 or 3 1/2 year gap between the event of the resurrection and translation (when those still alive become spirit beings, as per I Cor. 15:45-53) of the saints when Jesus returns and when He actually ends up landing on earth?    
Now there are texts that teach Christians will suffer persecution during the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21, the period of Satan's wrath), which is before the Day of the Lord (which is when God's wrath is inflicted on the earth).  These obviously aren't easily compatible with the view that all Christians go to heaven during the great tribulation to be protected.  For example, there's this in Jesus' great Olivet prophecy in Matt. 24:9:  ""Then they will deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all nations on account of My name.""  This can't be about unbelievers in the world, for the same world ""you"" is used about Christians (i.e., the disciples hearing Jesus talk back then in particular) in verses 4 and 6.  There is also the saints symbolically described as coming from under the altar when the 5th seal (which represents the great tribulation in time sequence) is opened, who were persecuted and killed and ask for God's vengeance (see Rev. 6:9-11).  The dragon waged war on the saints in Rev. 12:17.

irtzb71,Jayhawk_rock586,y0u2o0,"These scriptures, as well as Luke 21:34-36 refer to Jesus return to Earth. Specifically His Second Coming. 
1 Thessalonians 4:13-18 specifically talks about what is referred to as the rapture."
iru0nzm,rbibleuser,y0u2o0,"""The rapture"" is, unfortunately, a very muddied terminology these days. Based on the depictions in popular culture, I assume that we're talking about something like a global UFO abduction event, but where Jesus is the abductor? There is absolutely zero textual basis for this depiction, and no church father, theologian or other Christian scholar before the late 19th-century spoke of the relevant texts in this way. So, it's a completely novel concept that is alien to the text and repugnant to traditional belief.

The New Testament is very clear that, when we believe in Jesus, we receive eternal life and we *immediately* begin the process of ascension and glorification. For the duration of the earthly lifespan, we call this process *sanctification*. And when the Holy Spirit brings it to completion, we call it glorification (also called ""theosis"" or ""deification""). Read John 14-17, especially John 17 -- the entire purpose of salvation is so that we will be *unified with God* in Jesus Christ. Paul expands a lot on this, as well. And no, being unified with God has nothing to do with some fancied global UFO abduction foisted upon us by Jesus. The only way to truly understand deification is to walk in the Way. We are all being taught by God, Jer. 31:34, Is. 54:13."
iru9e8d,CaptainFL,y0u2o0,"Pre Trib rapture focus gives the devil a free pass by Christians ignoring Jesus’s warning on Antichrist. AC will establish his reign by Christians being ignorant of his work. Too busy preaching health n wealth. Well I tell you what, I m listening to Jesus. Not John Nelson Darby’s false pre-tribulation, hyper dispensational beliefs based on the psychic visions of a little girl. Look it up! 

Won’t be many Christians left at the Rapture, most will have died for not taking the “mark”. And don’t tell me they will be “Tribulation Saints”. The people who say that don’t understand Justification. 

It will happen before God rains down wrath on those who took the “mark”. Punishment from God. Those who say the Bible tells Christians they won’t face tribulation is afraid of Antichrist,  so they made up theology. If you want to study the Rapture go read Jesus in The Olivet Discourse, 1 and 2 Thess and Revelation. All of those, not just a quote out of context."
irv1k0j,GodandJesusSave,y0u2o0,"I had to delete my last comment after going over Matthew 24 again. Reading from verse 9 to verse 31, it looks like the chosen die in tribulation in verse 9. Then in verse 31, the chosen are gathered from the 4 winds (their spirits?). 

I think people think this signifies a rapture of people living on earth at the time, but I'm not so sure. 

Matthew 24:9   then they shall deliver you up to tribulation, and shall kill you, and ye shall be hated by all the nations because of my name

Clearly, the chosen are killed here.

Matthew 24:12-13   and because of the abounding lawlessness, the love of the many shall become cold; But he who did endure to the end, he shall be saved

This may at first appear that some will live until the end. But I think it's saying that anyone who did not become cold til the end (of their lives) shall be saved aka receive salvation.

Matthew 24:22   And if those days were not shortened, no flesh would have been saved; But because of the chosen, shall those days be shortened. 

If this is interpreted as, if the days of tribulation were not shortened, no flesh living in those days would receive salvation (not saved in the flesh as it appears at first glance), but because of the chosen, the tribulation shall be shortened (I'm thinking to maintain their declaration of faith until death from persecution), then a coherency arises. I realize many are looking for a happy escape here, but remember Jesus said, ""for whoever may will to save his life, shall lose it, and whoever may lose his life for my sake shall find it"" [Matthew 16:25]. 

Matthew 24:29-31   And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from the heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken; And then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in the heaven; And then shall all the tribes of the earth smite the breast, and they shall see the Son of Man coming upon the clouds of the heaven, with power and much glory; And he shall send his messengers with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his chosen from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens unto the ends thereof.

As I said earlier, this looks to me like the spirits of the chosen are gathered from the four winds. It also sounds to me like the tribes of the earth smiting the breast would be those who are not chosen.

I feel like I need to go back to Revelation to reflect on the camp of the saints to reconcile these matters further. Are the saints of the camp, those who have been resurrected, while those who are not chosen are still existing for a time until God rains fire upon them? 

Mankind has had trouble discerning these things for ages. People don't agree on them. The word ""rapture"" is actually nowhere stated in scripture. I think it might just be based on the books of Jesus/John/Matthew that describe the spirits being gathered... and then the writings of Paul that are highly controversial.

Matthew 24:2 ""You see all these, do you not?  Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here on stone upon another that will not be thrown down.""  Which when the Temple was destroyed some forty years later the invading army overturned every piece of the temple looking for gold and treasure.  Then in Matthew 24:36-51 Jesus is talking about his return, but he is using the up incoming invasion to illustrate the point.  Basically saying ""None of you know when this attack is going to come, and in the same way no one is going to know when I am going to return.  

The key here is in Mark 13:30 and in Matthew 24:34 where he says ""Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place.""  Jesus is talking to those gathered there, telling them what was about to happen, and telling them that it was all going to happen in their life time."
irvumg8,NathanStorm,y0u2o0,"The 'Rapture' is not to be found in the Bible, although it is vaguely based on the notion of a second coming of Jesus, which is in the Bible. It evolves this into a two-stage return, with a period of Tribulation either before or after his return, depending on whom you listen to.  
  
Barbara R. Rossing says, in The Rapture Exposed, that according to one critic, the Rapture has its origins in 1830, in Port Glasgow, Scotland, when fifteen-year-old Margaret MacDonald attended a healing service. There, she was said to have seen a vision of a two-stage return of Jesus Christ. The story of her vision was adopted and amplified by John Nelson Darby, the nineteenth-century founder of the Plymouth Brethren.  
  
Darby's new teaching was that Christ would return twice, first in secret to ""Rapture"" his church out of the world and up to heaven, then a second time after seven years of global tribulation for non-believers, to establish a Jerusalem-based kingdom on earth (called the ""Glorious Appearing"" - a phrase from Titus 2:13).  
  
Can you imagine millions of people suddenly rising up in the air ? Where would their bodies go? How would they survive in the vacuum of space? Does this mean that souls do not survive in heaven without their bodies? What about Christians already dead, their bodies long since disintegrated or cremated? So many questions and so few answers. The one answer you can be sure of is that Darby’s Rapture will never happen."
irz818z,NewPartyDress,y0u2o0,"All your comments are spot on. I can tell you've done a lot of bible study. I've read all your responses and agree.

Jesus (Groom) a shout, the trumpet. That's the rapture. When He returns as King, we, the church, will accompany Him, as will the post rapture converts.

I believe the rapture will happen in the Fall on the Feast of Trumpets /Rosh Hashanah. This begins the 70th week of Daniel... and the clock starts ticking toward the Day of the Lord. 

I believe it will be on this feast for several reasons:

1. It is the next Feast chronologically after Pentecost. It is a Harvest Feast after a long summer of growing (the church).

2. It's called the Feast of Trumpets, and a couple of times the sound of a Trumpet is mentioned in relation to the rapture in I Thessalonians 4:13,16 and I Corinthians 15:52.

3. The Feast of Trumpets is the only feast that lasts 2 days, as it must start on a New Moon and the day was not predictable, so, to be safe, the Jews honored 2 days as the Feast of Trumpets. It is the only feast for which it can be said, ""No one knows the day or the hour.""

I don't know why the Jews celebrate the New Year ""Rosh Hashanah"" on the 7th month as the Torah clearly states that the year begins on 1 Nisan, making Passover (our Savior's Death as the sacrificial lamb) the first Feast Day. 

Curious what you think of Feast of Trumpets being the time during which the rapture will occur?"

is443qr,truth-always-matters,y0u2o0,"
I do believe the Feast of Trumpets is significant but then again,  I think all the feasts God told Moses to keep are because it also helps Jesus followers to grasp meaning. Some Jews  keep the old new year before God told Moses to change it, which is odd, but then again some have 4 new years per year to mark 4 seasons. That's why following man gets us so confused. 

John the Baptist was born at Passover and he was 6 months older than Jesus. God provided two Holy feasts that lasted 8 days. One is Passover/Unleavened Bread which signified that John the Baptist was the forerunner/ harbinger for Jesus that year. John was born in the first month(Abib/Passover/full moon). Then we have the Feast of Tabernacles that also celebrates the 8th day. I believe Jesus was born during this time. 

If we understand that the Jews consider Marcheshvan(Chesvan) (Gregorian November) to be a dark and gloomy month with no feasts or holidays as they say it's reserved for the Messiah, to whom they don't believe Jesus is, I believe that's significant. Noah entered the Ark in Cheshvan. I believe these are parallels. 

I'm not one to predict the harpazo but I've studied the timeline using scripture and I find it compelling that Jesus could have been born during Tabernacles. I also believe the final day of Tabernacles will be the actual final return(second coming) because it seems to parallel the Days of Noah. 

 If His second return will be like the days of Noah, the harpazo will signify a 7 year warning of preparation for the Jews as Noah was given 7 days to prepare before God closed the door to the Ark.  The Jews will have the opportunity to see they were deceived by the AC and will have time to repent and turn to Jesus if they choose. Towards the end of the 7 years, the time is up for the Jews and they're either in or out. This is what Matthew 24:22 is describing ""In fact, unless that time of calamity is shortened, not a single person will survive. But it will be shortened for the sake of God’s chosen ones."" 
The Jews are the Father's chosen,  but we are of Jesus so this isn't about us. We are His Bride,  the Jews are not. This doesn't include Messianic Jews as they believe Jesus is the Messiah. 
 
There is also a distinction mentioned in the bible about Israel having only 2 seasons- summer (Aviv) and winter( Stav). God said to Noah, ""seed time and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter"" in Genesis 8. But what's mentioned is 3 harvests even though there's only 2 seasons. Harvests were during Aviv, summer, and Stav. Jesus was the first fruits therefore the Bride is the first harvest. The Jews that choose to believe on Jesus represent the second harvest just as the summer harvest was second, and any unbelievers that are left behind but avoid the MOTB, and seek Salvation in Jesus during Tribulation, they will represent the third harvest (autumn harvest). The third will have to go through the fire at the final day to be purified but their souls will be saved if their heart was transformed during the tribulation. The harvests show the parallels to end times. 

When we look at God's time-clock and what the Jews consider the 7th month, it is actually the 6th month to God as they are about 30 days off. The moon and the sun tells us our signs if we make Abib/Nisan/Passover the first month with the full moon as God instructed to Moses. But sadly,  it has changed along the way. Just as the children of Israel were supposed to tell the priests when the harvest was to begin,  now the priests tell them when it is. Once again, taking matters into their own hands. 

This year for example,  the Jews celebrated Passover on April 15-23

God's clock showed May 14-16

The Jews celebrated Rosh Hashanah (Feast of Trumpets) on September 25-27th. They still celebrated during this time even though the new moon wasn't seen until the evening of the 27th which doesn't align with God's Word. 

God's clock says it's October 25-27 and there's also going to be a partial solar eclipse on October 25th.

The Jews celebrated Day of Atonement on October 4-5. But it's supposed to be celebrated 9 days after FOT and that didn't occur until the 27th. So they were early.

God's clock says it's November 4-5.

The Jews celebrated Feast of Tabernacles October 9-16. But it's supposed to start 5 days after the Day of Atonement which should have been the 11th-18th but because the signs in the sky don't align with their chosen days it doesn't align properly.

God's clock says it's November 8-15 and then the 8th day. 

November 8th will be a blood moon, full moon, and a total lunar eclipse. 

It's also Cheshvan this year and coincidentally  the Jews expect their Messiah in Cheshvan and  the red heifers are in Israel already for the sacrifice. So the AC should be announced during this time in whatever year it's time for him.

Days of Noah aligns with Tabernacle times as well. Noah entered the Ark on day 1 and God gave him 7 days. On the 8th day it began(Tabernacles and the 8th Day). 

Crazily enough, the Days of Noah align with this year's Feast of Tabernacles and the blood moon, Shemita cycle ending and a new one beginning in addition to the 50th jubilee since the tribes returned and established their land in 1948.

There's so much info I could write a book here,  but it's enough to start researching if you choose to. 😊

Go check out Stellarium. You will find the signs that God shows us.  Just as He gave us the signs in the sky of the woman in travail on September 23, 2017. You will also see the tetrad moons that have taken place that are significant as well. We were told ""The firmament showeth His handiwork"" in Psalms 19:1 
I'm not sure why we ever deviated from that?? God placed the sun, moon, and stars to follow His time, but the world has changed it into an idol/false god system through NASA, science, mysticism, and new age beliefs.

Please don't believe me though,  I'm not a teacher. Believe God as He has given us so much to know His truth.  I just like to share what I've come to understand with others to help learn more of His time-clock. This is why I won't debate others. None of us know for certain, but if it aligns with scripture, I think that matters and I like to learn with those who understand these things as well. There's so much hate and ridicule in post replies that lack God's Word,  and I don't feel the truth is accepted here very often because it contradicts their worldly taught beliefs. So I dust off my feet and move on.❤🙏🙏🙏"
iru6rr8,truth-always-matters,y0u2o0,That is your understanding. You don't have to agree. But the bible is very clear to me as to when He returns. Not going to debate you. You'll know the truth when the time arrives.
iru74lp,CaptainFL,y0u2o0,Yep. Part of the cult of John Nelson Darby. Wrapped up in hyper dispensationalism. They like to swap the words “wrath” for “tribulation”. The church won’t face God’s wrath but it will face AC’s persecution. Totally separate events.
iru9v6e,truth-always-matters,y0u2o0,"Calling the bride up into the clouds isn't a coming down. You do not understand. I suggest you pray and allow the Holy Spirit to guide your understanding. You are leaning on your own understanding. The first coming was in phases,  He came as a baby,  became a teacher/ High Priest, was crucified,  died, went to hades to save souls, resurrected 3 days later, ascended, then left the gift of the Holy Spirit for believers.  That was the first coming. The second coming will be the wedding and He will fulfill the final 3 feasts. Trumpets, Atonement, and Tabernacle. I'm not going to debate about it. If you disagree,  move on. I'm not saying anything that twists scripture. You can believe whatever you want but scripture affirms my response."
iru4q45,ziamal4,y0u2o0,There is no distinction
iruhtvv,rbibleuser,y0u2o0,"The problem with the depiction of the Second Coming in popular culture is that it is usually portrayed as some kind of sky-apparition of a levitating angel-being, or something of that nature. While Scripture does use this kind of language to describe it in a few places, this imagery is clearly symbolic in nature. Jesus may literally levitate in the sky. He may literally rend the skies open. But even if he does do that, that's not really what the Bible is talking about, that is not really the purpose of using that imagery. The purpose is to point us to the structure of the Apocalypse itself, that is, to understand what the end of all things is, spiritually. It is a simultaneous rending asunder, and bringing together, just as childbirth rends asunder (the mother), and brings together (joins the parents with their child). This imagery points us to the spiritual structure of the Apocalypse, which will culminate in the final destruction of Satan and his angels (Rev. 20:7-15), and the creating of the New Heavens and New Earth (Rev. 21:1ff) Reading Revelation as a long string of events strung together like a pearl necklace from one end to the other is bound to lead to confusion. Rather, you have to read the text in light of the Old Testament prophecies which it is illuminating, extending, unifying and arranging. The book of Revelation puts the many scattered OT apocalyptic prophecies into a single framework. But to really understand that framework, you have to first understand the prophecies it is referencing..."

isa9j9x,NewPartyDress,y0u2o0,"You have given me so much to look into! Thank you. A love of God's word flows from knowing Jesus, the Word incarnate, and having the indwelling Holy Spirit. I am always surprised at how I can read a scripture passage I've read many times and still gain new understanding, knowledge and wisdom.

Just as God is the infinite Being, I believe His word has infinite knowledge. 

I was just reading Luke regarding Zacharias and Gabriel's visitation regarding John the B. 

Luke 1:8 So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division, 9 according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot fell to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.

So it seems Zacharias was doing his annual or semiannual priestly duties (I need to research this more). I had heard this idea several years ago, and it makes perfect sense to me that Christ was born on Tabernacles. I just meed to find the evidence that Zacharius was serving during summer. 

And, the idea of 6,000 years being allotted to mankind with the last 1,000 years being God's millennial Sabbat.

You have me excited all over again that this year's actual Feast of Trumpets has yet to happen 😁

Bless you! I will certainly check out stellarium.

But what confuses me here is that the AC being revealed is part of the seals being opened. The seven seal that bring about this tribulation can only be opened by Christ. So does it not follow that any tribulation that comes against the church during that time is directly connected to Christ opening the seals? So if we are not subject to His wrath, how does that jive? I thought the entire 7 years was God's judgement, not just the last 3.5 years?"
irvg2wm,CaptainFL,y0u2o0,"Lol, the Holy Spirit has given me understanding. Hence why I listen to Jesus over your cult of Darby. You probably don’t even know the history of pre trib.

irw3op6,truth-always-matters,y0u2o0,"Your lack of humility is showing in addition to your lack in understanding. But that's ok, God is very clear and He gives those who obey Him eyes to see. I could type down every verse that speaks to this, but it wouldn't matter to you, because your worldly knowledge is so superior, and  you'd rather think you're right than learn what God is speaking. Jesus spoke in parables for a reason after all. Jesus will show you His truth if you're actually a believer and I know you'll be grateful when the wedding takes place and you get to be with Jesus from that point on instead of enduring what's to come."
iruu64x,truth-always-matters,y0u2o0,Antichrist.
is29t63,CaptainFL,y0u2o0,"Well, first off calling it “splitting hairs” is delegitimizing God’s word. There is a monumental difference between Tribulation that comes from Antichrist. So jump to Rev 6:9. Read about those killed by Antichrist and their white robes for standing in that day. They are described through to Rev 6:11. The greatest Christians of all time! They will be like the martyrs from the Reformation and throughout history that died so we can have the true Gospel! Not that garbage from Rome.

Pick up at Rev 6:12. This is the Rapture. When Jesus will return, our blessed hope! Before this you read about those in white robes be slaughtered for the word of God. Please don’t think these were left behind Tribulation Saints. They are Tribulation Saints, but they were leftovers after the Rapture. Oh no my friend. That is ignorance of Justification. Assuming you are saved, and I are saved from “womb to tomb” to quote Dr. Donald Barnhouse. And those Saints will be too. 

Look at the “signs” here. They are the same as Jesus spoke of on the Mount of Olives when asked about his return. Earthquake, stars fall, sun black. (Same signs in the Old Testament’s description of when messiah would come at the “Day of the Lord”. 

Through Rev 6:12-16 describes the reaction to the 2nd Coming of those that had been beheading Christians. Corrupt governments across the globe that made allegiance to Antichrist. 

Rev 6:17 This verse literally, literally says “For the great day of his wrath has come”. It doesn’t say “tribulation”. Tribulation is done at this point. Those in white robes are in heaven after being killed for not taking the “mark”. This is now “wrath”. From God. God did not kill those in the white robes. God will wipe out those during “wrath” with angels and different ways described in the trumpets and vials. 

I don’t think God would appreciate Antichrist being attributed God’s “wrath” on those that took the “mark”. Nor would God appreciate being attributed with the murder of those that didn’t take “mark”, “666”. Maybe think about that. I definitely wouldn’t call that a “splitting hairs” issue."
irw65am,truth-always-matters,y0u2o0,"Hmmm, I can tell just by your response that you lack understanding and the ability to discern the truth. I don't have one problem serving Jesus, dying for Jesus,  or living through an entire tribulation of hell on earth for Jesus.  I do not fear because I have Jesus in my heart which has been transformed to worship Him only. I do not know of anyone named Darby, the cult you speak of. I only read the bible to receive the Word from God. Like I mentioned to the other poster,  if you're a true believer,  you will be grateful for the wedding that takes place and the transformation of our human bodies and not being here, not because of the tribulation taking place on earth, but because of being in the wedding chamber will be beyond words with Jesus. It's all in scripture,  no need for any other book to show us His truth. You lack humility and would rather think you're right than actually get into scripture and understand the parables and events that God the Father spoke to, as well as Jesus at His first coming. But it doesn't matter that you don't believe me as it's not about me,  just as long as you believe on Jesus Christ and have that relationship, these finer details will be shown to us by Jesus when we're harpazoed."

irxzbrf,truth-always-matters,y0u2o0,"Sadly, you are deceived. You are exactly who Jesus warned us about. You twist scripture to deceive others. I will dust off my feet and exit this conversation."
irxkidz,truth-always-matters,y0u2o0,"Not ignorant at all. We've been dealing with trials and tribulations our whole existence. People are being murdered and beheaded in current times for their faith on Jesus. We are enduring first deaths through sickness by diseases, pestilence(viruses), our food is poisoned, our water is poisoned, even the air we breath is poisoned. We are poisoned through social media, television,  medications, treatments, and cures. We endure earthquakes, storms, hurricanes and tsunamis.  We are not spared from either of these two things, trials and tribulation. 
What we are spared from is the final week/hour/year. You need to understand the meaning of seven. 7 years is as 1 year(Shemita cycles) 50 years(jubilee) is as 1 cycle up to 120 cycle years until end times. 120 years wasn't the age of a person it was the age of our time here and was 120 cycles of 50 years in total before the MR. 
If you understand what God is saying then you will understand what I'm saying. If you understand Jacob's trouble, then you'll understand that tribulation is what believers are spared from.
 God's WRATH comes on the final remaining on earth. You keep telling me I'm wrong and portraying yourself as all knowing of these things,  but scripture doesn't align with what you ""choose to believe."" That's why I tell you I won't debate end times with you,  because you believe your own ways which have been taught by the world. 
Scripture is so clear it can't be refuted,  but it is often twisted to suit an agenda just as satan likes to do with everything.  Those who don't have faith in the Word and being harpazoed by Jesus,  will certainly not have the faith to withstand everything we are going through here on earth until the end.  
Peter denied Jesus 3 times but Jesus knew that Peter would see the truth and turn back to Him to lead others to Him.  Even though satan shook him trying to make him lose his faith and fall from grace,  it did not happen because Jesus is mightier than satan, and He knew Peter would repent of his own fear and ways and get it right.  He was persecuted because of that faith and he knew he'd see Jesus again and that's how he didn't fall for satan's schemes. His faith endured until the end. 
You are falling for satan's schemes if you don't believe in the wedding(believers receiving their righteousness through Christ) that will take place in the wedding chamber that Jesus is preparing, while His father is preparing the New Heaven/New Jerusalem/New Earth.
 The Father will send His Son, Jesus,  when He says its time. Just as the father of the groom will send his son to receive his bride when the chamber is ready for them. The Father decides in both instances. 
You don't believe Paul when he was speaking to the Thessalonians. You don't understand Matthew because you're leaning on your own understanding. Matthew, John, Acts, Thessalonians, II Corinthians, Revelation and so many others all speak to this. But because you are haughty, you do not listen."

Jesus is not the God figuring in OT because Jesus is the human incarnation of God which incarnation happens only through Mary in the NT.  Before such incarnation,the second person of the Trinity who was to become Jesus, was with God himself and was known as the Word and not as Jesus.Now read John 1:1-3 and 1:14 which make the position clear.

1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. 2He was with God in the beginning. 3Through Him all things were made, and without Him nothing was made that has been made.

ismjcbi,Traditional_Bell7883,y5wrmp,"Some people believe that the mentions of the ""the Angel of the LORD"" in the OT are Christophanies (i.e., pre-incarnate physical appearances of Jesus Christ). The phrase occurs in some 64 verses in the OT. The word ""angel"", after all, simply means ""messenger"", not necessarily how we understand it today as a shiny, winged fairy-like being with a halo, so any normal dude who is a messenger (you and I included) would by definition qualify to be called an ""angel"". Christ, the second person in the Trinity, would definitely qualify to be God's messenger or Angel. Yet, we see that ""the Angel of the LORD"" in the OT was not simply any angel like Gabriel, Michael, etc.

It was preceded by the definite article ""the"", i.e. it referred to only one specific being. Moreover, the Angel of the LORD spoke as God, identified Himself with God, and exercised the responsibilities of God (Ge. 16:7-12; 21:17-18; 22:11-18; Ex. 3:2; Jdg. 2:1-4; 5:23; 6:11-24; 13:3-22; 2 Sam. 24:16; Zech. 1:12; 3:1; 12:8). In several of these appearances, those who saw the Angel of the LORD feared for their lives because they had “seen the LORD.” Therefore, it is clear that in at least some instances, the Angel of the LORD was a theophany (an appearance of God in physical form) or Christophany."

Exodus 24:9-11 ESV
Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up, [10] and they saw the God of Israel. There was under his feet as it were a pavement of sapphire stone, like the very heaven for clearness. [11] And he did not lay his hand on the chief men of the people of Israel; they beheld God, and ate and drank.

Isaiah 6, Ezekiel 10, John 12:41, 

Contrast this meeting with Moses other face to face meeting with God. 

Exodus 33:12-23 ESV
Moses said to the LORD, ""See, you say to me, 'Bring up this people,' but you have not let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found favor in my sight.' [13] Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight, please show me now your ways, that I may know you in order to find favor in your sight. Consider too that this nation is your people."" [14] And he said, ""My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."" [15] And he said to him, ""If your presence will not go with me, do not bring us up from here. [16] For how shall it be known that I have found favor in your sight, I and your people? Is it not in your going with us, so that we are distinct, I and your people, from every other people on the face of the earth?"" [17] And the LORD said to Moses, ""This very thing that you have spoken I will do, for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name."" [18] Moses said, ""Please show me your glory."" [19] And he said, ""I will make all my goodness pass before you and will proclaim before you my name 'The LORD.' And I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. [20] But,"" he said, ""you cannot see my face, for man shall not see me and live."" [21] And the LORD said, ""Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock, [22] and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by. [23] Then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back, but my face shall not be seen.""

Exodus 34:1-9,29-35 ESV
The LORD said to Moses, ""Cut for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets, which you broke. [2] Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain. [3] No one shall come up with you, and let no one be seen throughout all the mountain. Let no flocks or herds graze opposite that mountain."" [4] So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first. And he rose early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand two tablets of stone. [5] The LORD descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. [6] The LORD passed before him and proclaimed, ""The LORD, the LORD, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness, [7] keeping steadfast love for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation."" [8] And Moses quickly bowed his head toward the earth and worshiped. [9] And he said, ""If now I have found favor in your sight, O Lord, please let the Lord go in the midst of us, for it is a stiff-necked people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance."" [29] When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, with the two tablets of the testimony in his hand as he came down from the mountain, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. [30] Aaron and all the people of Israel saw Moses, and behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come near him. [31] But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses talked with them. [32] Afterward all the people of Israel came near, and he commanded them all that the LORD had spoken with him in Mount Sinai. [33] And when Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. [34] Whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he would remove the veil, until he came out. And when he came out and told the people of Israel what he was commanded, [35] the people of Israel would see the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses' face was shining. And Moses would put the veil over his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

Moses talked face to face, but through a cloud. 
He was given a glow of the glory of God that caused his face to shine. 
This glow remained until his death,  being renewed every time moses talked to God in the tabernacle.
From this we learn that Moses wore a veil for the rest of his life. 
Because of the glory reflected from his face."

For example, here is the translation from Hebrew of Genesis 2:8 - ""The LORD God planted a garden toward the east, in Eden; and there He placed the man whom He had formed."" NASB

isph31m,ArchaicChaos,y5wrmp,"I don't think it follows that the angel of the Lord was necessarily God. 

>The word ""angel"", after all, simply means ""messenger"",

Yes, the word for angel isn't a word which *necessarily* refers to the nature of the thing. Man can be a messenger/angel. Even a donkey can be a messenger/angel. However, saying that God is a messenger for God would not only be pretty strange language, but it's doubtful that this is how the original audience would have understood the concept. God's messenger is God? Some try to make it seem like the angel is one person giving the message of another person, but both persons are God. But if each person is all-knowing, and further, if they share a will, how can their message be anything but the same message? How can one be a messenger for another? Given that angels regularly were both mediators and messengers in the OT, it's clear that they understood this messenger to be ontologically what we'd call an angelic being. The Hebrews writer makes his letter hinging mostly on this point. The law given by angels. Paul makes the same point. ""The religion of Angels."" They would be our strongest representatives of how the Jewish mind understood the concept.

> Yet, we see that ""the Angel of the LORD"" in the OT was not simply any angel like Gabriel, Michael, etc.

This isn't clear. Many scholars (for example, the Orthodox Study Bible) denotes that the angel of the lord in Zechariah was actually an angel, probably Gabriel, they ascribe it to. Also, in Matthew 1, we find the term ""the angel of the lord"" being used of what Luke says is Gabriel. And yes, the definite article is used, not that it really matters tbh. If Gabriel, *one of the chief angels*, can be the angel of the lord in these places, what stops him from being so in the OT? Also, Isaiah 63:9-10 makes it sound as if the angel of God's presence/face is the holy spirit through synonymous parallelism. Why can't this angel be the third person of the Trinity? Another scholarly source, the NET study Bible, notes that they do not actually believe there is any reason to assume ""the angel of the lord"" is the same angel in all places, and deny they believe it is Christ. In other words, this isn't just a random opinion.

>It was preceded by the definite article ""the"", i.e. it referred to only one specific being.

That's not how the definite article works. The definite article indicates a definite subject rather than an indefinite subject. There's a difference between ""a dog"" and ""the dog."" We mean something specific. But we don't need to assume that whenever someone say ""the dog"" we are always only ever talking about the one and the same dog. If you want to use this line of reasoning, I refer you back to Matthew and Luke because it tells us who that was, Gabriel. Not Christ.

>Moreover, the Angel of the LORD spoke as God, identified Himself with God, and exercised the responsibilities of God

This is the role of a messenger of any sort. When a king sends his servant, the servant is to represent the king, and how you treat his servant is how you treat the king. The messenger comes in the glory and honour of the king. When you kill the messenger, you're essentially saying that if the king himself came, you would have killed him as well. If the ""messenger"" of the Lord really is a messenger, this is exactly what we would expect him to do. Further, in Exodus 23:20-25 we find God introducing the angel of the Lord, and he says ""my name is in him."" God's placed his own name on this angel, so yes, the angel comes in the name of God. Don't you know that we come in the name of God and the name of Christ? It doesn't mean that we are Christ or we are God. Jesus came in the name of his Father (Micah 5:4, John 17:11) and he isn't his Father, is he? Of course not. In Exodus 23:22 notice what it says. ""If you listen to *his* voice, and do *all that I say.*"" His voice is what I say. Yes, this angel is God's messenger. He should speak as if he's God, but he shouldn't be confused with him. 

>In several of these appearances, those who saw the Angel of the LORD feared for their lives because they had “seen the LORD.”

Let's take the first example of this, Hagar. She says ""I have seen the Lord who has seen me."" Even if we take this as her believing she'd seen God himself, it's quite obvious she didn't, or she would be dead. This is precisely what Manoah and his wife said. Manoah asked ""why did God show himself to me, because now I will die"" and his wife reasoned that this obviously isn't the case. Hagar was a poor slave girl of Abraham with no Bible. Do you think she had detailed knowledge of angels and how they work? It's easy to assume she thought she'd seen God himself. Jacob as well. Exodus 23 hadn't yet happened. The angel wasn't explained and didn't need to be. Simply put, if the angel was God, they would have died. 

I don't think it follows at all that the angel of the lord just is Jesus. I think that it's strange that in the gospels, Jesus never says that he wrestled with Jacob, or spoke face to face with Moses, or killed an army in their sleep, or spoke to Gideon. You don't find Jesus taking any credit for being this angel or doing these things. Shouldn't this cast doubt on the whole assertion? The letter to the Hebrews makes the great point that Jesus is superior to the angels by being resurrected and seated on God's throne for his life and death as a man. Therefore, the covenant Jesus gives is superior to the covenant the angels gave in the OT. This OT covenant was given by angels, including the angel of the Lord, to Moses himself. If this angel is Jesus, giving the old law, then the Hebrews writer has destroyed his own point. He has made the point that Jesus' law is superior to Jesus' law. And if this isn't clear enough, he begins his letter by telling us that God did *not* speak to his OT prophets in a son, but it is *in these last days* that God has spoken to us in a son, Hebrews 1:1-2. No, the angel of the lord isn't Jesus, or the preincarnate son in any passage or occasion."

ispcnya,ArchaicChaos,y5wrmp,"Reddit is sometimes very hit and miss. One person can say this and be the most upvoted, and someone else say the same thing and be the most down voted. I agree with you. ""Just look it up"" isn't a terribly helpful answer. I think maybe your down votes came from the assertion that he's lazy. I probably wouldn't have used that word, but you're correct in asserting that this isn't helpful info. I have spent a long time studying Christophanies myself from top scholarly literature and early church fathers and I, along with many others, are convinced that there are none in the OT. Just telling someone to Google it isn't helpful. It probably will lead them into confusion on this topic because they won't get a dialogue of both sides the way they will here on reddit, where people of varying opinions are free to express both sides.

So no, he shouldn't ""just Google it."" I find the term ""Christophany"" itself pretty paradoxical. Because if we are going to be honest about Trinitarian doctrine, the son was not ""the Christ"" until he was anointed by the Spirit, and this didn't happen in the OT. A theophanic appearance of Christ can't happen if he's not yet Christ, that's an anachronistic fallacy. Further, the idea of these Christophanies is that there's something substantially distinct about Christ which makes him visible and the Father invisible. Therefore, it can't be the Father being seen, but it must be the son. If Christophanies are built on this assumption, then we have a problem. Christ can't have a substantial (meaning ontological substance) difference from the Father preincarnation, nor should he be able to be seen preincarnation. The assumption of flesh in an incarnation is what makes his visible, so how can he be visible before he assumes flesh? 

If you just Google Christophanies you won't find these issues being debated or even discussed. You'll just find people building a case on a bad and unsubstantiated premise of Christ being seen and God being unseen and yet they are one and the same substance. God is said to not be seen because he would kill us due to his glory being too overwhelming with man in our present state. No one *can* see God and live. If glory is part of the substance of God, then Christ must have the same glory if he is of the same substance. So how can Christ be seen before his incarnation and yet we not die? Researching Christophanies won't answer this issue. There are some sources which attempt to answer these questions, but fail at doing so. So telling him to ""just Google it"" is a huge mistake. You shouldn't have been downvoted."
ismqgel,Imaginary_Athlete_56,y5wrmp,Yes. I was confused here. Thought the same?
ismr3nl,Sawfish1212,y5wrmp,"If you read the scriptures above,  God spoke to Moses, and he is probably the only one to ever get that privilege.

 Every other appearance is Jesus, from eden, to Abraham, and on. This is why God said ""let us make"" in creation. Jesus is God, and was creating everything according to the plan of God the father. This is the only way to understand it all in light of John chapter 1 ""nothing was made that was not made by him"". 

Moses recorded creation, John turned the camera around and showed us the creator, Jesus, creating according to his father's plans. 

Israel was to be the bride of Jesus, but they refused him, first with their idols then with the cross, exactly as he described in the parable of the vineyard."

This response doest make much sense to me. And although it is possible I am rather doubtful.

Alternatively, we might note that the word angel can also just mean measanger. So perhaps they were suggesting that Peter had sent a messager. This makes more sense in context. Rhoda says that Peter is at the door, and every one corrects her saying, ""you must have misunderstood, Peter is in jail.  the person outside probably said they were a messager FROM Peter. Aka, peters messenger, aka, peters 'angel'. ""

This theory makes more sense to me."
ipp86sl,SeekSweepGreet,xmkzv8,"This is among the experiences of the early church. The church had a swift growth. Along with this, came the minds & beliefs of the people. Inspite of this, God still worked with His people, though they still hung to their erroneous beliefs, which, as they progressed, God would educate them on.

We see other instances of this same tendency to think things are ghosts, spirits or angels(translation): **Matt 14:25-26**, **Luke 24:37-39**. At this point in human history, Greek thought permeated much of the thinking of many, as it would today.

They needed to, and would eventually unlearn errors by way of letters & preaching from the apostles.

ippfcu9,CrossCutMaker,xmkzv8,"No, they were so surprised to see Peter, they didn't believe it. It was Peter all along (no visible angel)."
ipsxzg7,Baconsommh,xmkzv8,"His guardian angel, I assume. As in the Book of Tobit, the angel Raphael plays a similar function."
ipuoug4,AccomplishedAuthor3,xmkzv8,"Peter's angel broke him out of jail. They went right past the guards, thru locked doors and outside to freedom when the angel suddenly left Peter Acts 12:10  and he went to knock on Mary's  door, the mother of Mark.  They assumed Peter was an angel, because they knew Peter was in jail with little hope of being released in the middle of the night. Yet there he was knocking on their door."

ipoxbjq,s_lena,xmkzv8,"I’d love to hear more about your personal experience with guardian angels!

Jesus does seem to imply that we have them “See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven.” (Matthew‬ ‭18:10‬)"
ipoww6g,Imaginary_Athlete_56,xmkzv8,"I’m asking about after he got out. When his friends said, it can’t be him at the door. It must be his angel…"
ippj190,Imaginary_Athlete_56,xmkzv8,Yes but why did they say it was “his” angel? Why even say that?
ipu7agh,RubySapphire19,xmkzv8,"I have to respectfully disagree with you on this interpretation, because Jesus in context isn't talking about guardian angels in the sense that we all have one. He specifically refers to God's spirit camping all around those fearing his name. 

Notice in an earlier verse that he refers to being humble like children, evidently meaning we follow God's direction and stick close to his commandments, and his Spirit camps all around us as a protection. He can use the angels that way, but we don't receive miraculous protection in the way some stipulate."
ipoxw4y,MaxwellHillbilly,xmkzv8,"They've been praying all night I have to assume some of them could see into the spirit realm...

Be good, love others, forgive freely, start being charitable. Making disciples doesn't need to be knocking on doors, in fact I don't see much evidence that any Christians ever did, and the faith exploded. Discipleship will occur when you live a truly converted faith, and you give example to others.

I'm not a wonderful ""teacher"" by any means but I can give my statement that I asked God to guide me and lead me to truth. He did and continues to do so. It was simply reading the Bible. Through Bible reading I found Christ and started following him. The Bible says the way to salvation is found through Jesus (Acts 4:12), not through Bible teachers or a particular religion. Honestly, taking a good hard look at my life and realizing how far off I was from righteousness really hit home. Treating people with sincere kindness, helping others whenever I can, and not abandoning those I love is my main focus in life now...and I couldn't be happier!! 

I wish you the best on your personal spiritual journey!"
ipz4uof,Automatic-Intern-524,xo6yop,"The thing about being in JW is that they had answers and directions for everything. We find out that they were BS answers, but answers none the less. When you leave you have to get answers on your own. 

The Kingdom is not what we were taught in JW. When Jesus came to earth, he preached that the kingdom of heavens in near and demonstrated the power of kingdom most particularly over wicked spirits - angels and demons. This is the power behind physical rulership. So he showed that he was more powerful. Plus he had power over the effects of sin by healing others. 

He wasn't anointed king in 1914 as we were taught. He said all authority was given him in heaven and on earth in 33 CE (Matthew 28:18). He told his disciples that the kingdom power would come upon them, and then go be witnesses of HIM (not Jehovah as we were taught) at Acts 1:8. Paul even said that the kingdom of God is not in words but in power (1 Corinthians 4:20). So seeking first the kingdom means learning more about it and it's power and using it. It's the same with his righteousness. Seeking it along with the kingdom would mean understanding it too. Romans 1:17 shows that God's righteousness is being revealed from faith for faith (start to finish). So the more we live by faith, the more his righteousness is revealed to us. 

When you read through Acts, you can see how people became disciples of Jesus. Yes some preached about the kingdom, but they also demonstrated its power. Many became disciples by their observations of Christians and displays of kingdom power. What we did as JW was go out and preach about the JW kingdom and the JW Jesus which wasn't the Scriptural Jesus nor the Scriptural kingdom. We went out to convert people to the JW religion not make disciples of Jesus. 

It's a different view that we have to take on once we leave the religion."

iroxpgt,ArchaicChaos,xzxdkb,">What was Jesus involvement in human affairs in the OT. 

He had none. He didn't exist yet. That's kinda like asking what you and I's involvements are in the OT. Jesus was prophesied, that's about it. 

If you're looking for Unitarians who think Jesus preexisted in the OT, you should try Arian groups.

>Study guide/aid on the I AM statements etc. in the Bible. 

Depends, again, on what exactly you're looking for. Unitarians don't really make a big thing of ""I am"" statements because to us, they are common everyday statements and not worth writing a book on. It's the Trinitarians who think these statements are divine declarations. If you're asking about our responses to them, there's a few sources I can give you. But idk what you're asking exactly."
is6l14k,John_17-17,xzxdkb,"You can't.

To make these statements, you have to mistranslate 2 different verses.

* Ex 3:14*“I Shall Become Who I am Becoming / I Shall Become has sent me”* and not “I am what I am” (Go to Hebrew Scriptures, Ex 3 @ [http://www.scripture4all.org](http://www.scripture4all.org))

J Washington Watts, Professor of Old Testament, New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, 1930-1968. A Distinctive Translation of Exodus With An Interpretative Outline, 1977, pp.140,1.  
*""Such a translation \[in English\] as ""I am what I am"" appears to be ruled out completely by the fact that the \[Hebrew\] verbs here are imperfects. ""I am"" is the normal translation of the Hebrew perfect, not an imperfect...* 

* John 8:59

The Expository Times, 1996, page 302 by Kenneth Mckay.  
*""in John 8:58: prin Abraam genesthai ego eimi, which would be most naturally translated*   
*'I have been in existence since before Abraham was born', if it were not for the obsession with the simple words 'I am'."" . . . ""If we take the Greek words in their natural meaning, as we surely should, the claim to have been in existence for so long is in itself a staggering one, quite enough to provoke the crowd's violent reaction.""*

Only by mistranslating Ex 3:14 and John 8:58, can you make the Bible teach something not found in scripture."
iroy6kw,Imaginary_Athlete_56,xzxdkb,"I guess I’m trying to refute the trinitarian position re the I AM statements. 

I have a friend who believes that Jesus had major contact with man in the Old Testament. 

She bases this on man being unable to approach God in our sinful state. 

She assumes Jesus must have had contact and involvement prior to his human existence to communicate on gods behalf. 

I would like to explore this idea with her."
irp2im6,ArchaicChaos,xzxdkb,"I see. Well a quick response to the I am statements is a post I've made [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BiblicalUnitarian/comments/xgwu0y/john_1030_short_answer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) and you can follow the links for more info. There are some books by Anthony Buzzard and ""One God and One Lord"" and Thomas Belshams book on Christology which speak on the subject but not exclusively. 

As far as man approaching Jesus in the OT because we can't approach God, I don't quite get what she thinks Jesus is. If Jesus is God, why is he any more approachable? If Jesus was a man, when he was the offensive party and couldn't mediate. If he was an angel, then the letter to the Hebrews must be discarded, as it explicitly compares Jesus to the angels. 

Man not being able to approach God is why God only revealed himself in smoke and fire and through angels, and only to Moses in shadows. This is why the high priests had sacrifices and purification rituals, to demonstrate our distance from God. 

Whatever Jesus is to her, I don't see how it solves her problem."

irgeuo9,sweet-tea-13,xyb2i3,"Considering the God you believe in allowed Satan to take control of the world to cause an untold amount of pain and suffering for literally no other reason than to ""prove a point"", your God is a fucking dick. Even *if* I believed in his existence I'd rather die than worship the monster portrayed in the Bible. It wasn't Satan who sent 2 bears to maul 42 CHILDREN to death because they made fun of a bald man (2 Kings 2:23-25). And that's just one example of many. 

I'm going to live my life helping others and being a good person because that's what I want to do. Not because I'm scared of a divine punishment or expect an everlasting reward. Even if there is no God and life is essentially ""meaningless"", helping others here and now is what gives my life meaning. I'd assume that when I die if there were a loving God my actions and chocies in life are what would matter, but if regardless of how I lived my life, if I'm going to be punished because I didn't  manage to pick one specific organization to follow out of countless others, then I'm fine with that. 

My moral standards would never allow me to stoop so low as to follow an organization run by 8 imperfect men who themselves admit are not inspired by God, an organization that hides pedophiles and covers up csa. An organization that ticks every box of the BITE model for being a manipulative high-control cult. I pity anyone who treats this life as something to just ""get through"" until their perceived real life begins. Is life perfect? Nope.

I am thankful I am no longer in that cult! People like them (yeah they are entitled to their opinion) makes us all reconfirm why we decided to leave in the first place! I signed a resignation letter because the elders made me! They had blank faces when they read it and had nothing to say! One of my reasons was I was not going to continue in an organization that protects others from sexual abuse/assault. Instead they just get a slap on the wrist and the very next assembly that elder has a talk about sexual assault! (Pedophiles) Very fitting right? Many of my friends have left for the same reason! 

Also the fact that the religion kept shoving down our throats that god was like a father and loved his kids and he disciplined his kids like one. That we should love him as such; just crazy! Even my own father that is an atheist said; “that’s one thing I will never understand about that religion. If we are really made from his image, are you really telling me as an imperfect father; I am going to love you more than him?”

My own dad is a good man! We weren’t close growing up but now I live like he has in a way to be a good human being. I don’t have to follow someone’s leadership to do that. I’m my own person. I am still healing the traumas I went through! But, I am thankful I am no longer there!

itc9z00,my_skeleton_fell_off,yapk3c,"If I were to watch a child being deceived and then kidnapped, having done nothing to stop it, who is the more blameworthy? The child or me? 

Adam failed to lead as he was meant to. This is what happens when men fail to lead. In Timothy, we see this echoed again. Unfortunately, there is an illogical push in our society today to make everything ""equal"". In this mad rush to make everything ""equal"", mankind has been willing to walk all over God's design for us. What is that design? Men are to lead. Women are a help meet. It seems to me that neither of these roles is more important than the other. They are simply roles. Because with God there is no ""respect of persons"" - meaning he's looking deeper than something so benign as our race, our gender, our role, or anything else superficial. He's looking at our hearts.

As ""advanced"" as we claim to be, we are still in many ways screaming up at God saying ""It's not fair!"" But I'm beginning to wander off topic here."
itc5uhg,Traditional_Bell7883,yapk3c,"Adam was not anymore righteous than Eve.

1 Tim. 2:14 states plainly that Adam was not deceived. The question is not whether he would or wouldn't, or could or couldn't. 1 Tim. 2:14 provides a factual, not a speculative, statement: he ""was not deceived"". Period. 

Eve's failure was that she was deceived. Adam's failure was not because he was deceived, but his culpability is compounded precisely **because he was not deceived** -- because he was silent, complicit and disobedient. He was present at the scene (Ge. 3:6, ""...she also gave to her husband **with her**, and he ate""), could have spoken up, but he didn't. He chose to participate in the offence with Eve, as an accomplice (Ge. 3:17, ""... because you have heeded the voice of your wife...""). As the one to whom God had given the command directly, he should have known better. In fact, Ro. 5:19 states that Adam's sin was disobedience: ""For as by one man's **disobedience** many were made sinners, so also by one Man's obedience many will be made righteous."" So it is plain that Adam knew what he should have done, but chose not to do it. Put differently this was rebellion. Free will in rebellion. The very first recorded instance of free will.

And when found out, he then played the victim card, blaming Eve, and blaming God for giving him Eve: ""Then the man said, 'The woman **whom You gave** to be with me, **she gave** me of the tree, and I ate'. (Ge. 3:12). Oh poor him -- it was God's fault, Eve's fault, and he was just the innocent victim! He blamed everyone but himself -- ""and I ate"", in direct contravention of the command of God personally communicated to him in Ge. 2:17 ""...you shall not eat..."".  Spineless!

Deception vs. disobedience -- which is worse? At least Eve could have pled ignorance. Adam had no excuse. He was not deceived, thus his transgression was worse. Far worse. His was unwarranted complicity, a failure of obedience, a failure of moral responsibility, a failure of leadership, and a failure of accountability."

“And Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.”
‭‭

https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-14.htm#lexicon

Admittedly I’m not a Greek scholar so this is just what I’m able to gather: Became is the key word. It’s singular in Greek (according to bible hub) so if that’s the case Paul wasn’t referring to Adam becoming a transgressor.  Not that Adam wasn’t also disobedient but the point Paul is making is more clear with the context of the surrounding verses:

“Let a woman learn in silence with full submission. I permit no woman to teach or to have authority over a man; she is to keep silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet she will be saved through childbearing, provided they continue in faith and love and holiness, with modesty.”
‭‭1 Timothy‬ ‭2‬:‭11‬-‭15‬ ‭NRSV"
itco1yb,nickshattell,yapk3c,"I would recommend examining the words in Genesis to better understand this. 

As you can see, Adam and Eve were first joined without shame, and became one flesh (Genesis 2:24). This means that any deception on the part of one would be shared by the other (they act as one flesh).

While Eve was deceived with a partial truth, it was Adam's pride that goes along with this deception. We know this because the words of the serpent (""you will be like God"" - Genesis 3:5) and Eve's desires for wisdom (Genesis 3:6) - so this shows that Adam's pride also desired to be like God and gain the external appearances of wisdom (the delights of the fruit).

From the standpoint of the fulfilled Word, there is much to say on this. For example, Jesus is born of a virgin mother and receives His Spirit from God the Father. This shows that all flesh is considered ""female"" in the spiritual sense - because all human beings gain their physical bodies during gestation in their mothers (Eve is called the mother of all living because even the ancients could understand this based on the physical act of childbirth through mothers). After Adam eats the fruit, he is no longer in God's Image and is said only to be in God's likeness (Genesis 5:1) - and sons are born in the image and likeness of their fathers (Genesis 5:3). Without going into too much detail in the chronological order of things that follow, this ultimately leads to the male priestly and kingly anointing(s) over Israel and Judah (beginning with Moses who consecrates Aaron and Joshua). This anointing comes to be profaned to the fullness of pride, leading to the advent of the Christ (meaning the Anointed One). God takes no male seed from the males of Israel and Judah. Jesus pours out the things He inherited through gestation in the virgin mother, and does not reach out to take from the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, and is thereby granted access to the Tree of Life (God's Image)."
itd881x,rbibleuser,yapk3c,"Neither of your options is correct. The NKJV I think captures this verse properly, ""And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, fell into transgression."" (1 Tim. 2:14 NKJV) The emphasis is not on the fact *that* Eve fell into transgression, because we know that they *both* fell into transgression. Rather, the emphasis is on *how* she fell into transgression. Adam fell into transgression by willful disobedience, Eve through deception. That makes Adam's guilt worse, not better, but Adam's headship exhibits the divine pattern, even in the Fall, since the Snake was not able to deceive Adam.

> Many times we (Christian men) like to put it all on the women Eve being at fault for original sin… 

I've always found this claim puzzling. I was raised in some of the most extreme conservative churches, and I never once heard anything along the lines that ""it's Eve's fault that the Fall happened"". Quite the opposite, the claim was always that a man is the head of the household and, therefore, it is he who is answerable to God for that household. In my opinion, the devil has sent false-agents to spread this nonsense about ""it's all Eve's fault"" because you have to be pretty much completely ignorant of Scripture to come to that conclusion."
itcrj9j,Aditeuri,yapk3c,"The letters of 1-2 Timothy and Titus all but universally accepted as pseudepigraphal texts merely written in Paul’s name several decades after his death, likely in response to the Acts of Paul and Thecla, which depict a prominent woman preacher (and likely understood to have been an apostle) which were circulating in the churches as bona fide scripture and were very popular.

So someone or some group took issue with this and sought to diminish and disparage women leaders in the church (something that was very common in the ministries of Jesus and the apostles) in the early to mid 2nd century when bishops were trying to consolidate their authority in the absence of the apostles, and probably feeling threatened by the prospect of women in leadership."

) 

In addition to their evil choice, their firstborn (Cain) is also evil, he kills his brother Abel. As God said ""If you do what is right, will you not be accepted? But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at your door."" 

Adam and Eve didn't listen to God, neither did Cain. They are evil also, not just humanity.

In the Eden story from Genesis, they both fell into transgression and both were scolded by God for it.  But, that's what's in Genesis.  It doesn't mean this is what the author of 1 Timothy wrote.  In my view, the reasoning given in Timothy looks very thin - the woman was created second, therefore women are second-class citizens, in church?  This doesn't follow at all.  And, of course, in the Eden story, they both ate that fruit.  If one was deceived, wasn't the other one equally deceived?

God told adam not to eat from a very specific tree in the garden. and so the serpent fooled her, not adam. yes sin entered into the world by adam. There are several reasons why Adam is to blame for the fall of humanity. Adam was created first, and his wife was created to be a “suitable helper” (Genesis 2:18, BSB). God held Adam responsible for his family, as seen in the fact that God sought out Adam specifically (Genesis 3:9). Also, in His conversation with Adam and Eve, God questioned Adam first (Genesis 3:9-13), even though Eve sinned before Adam. Adam, as the leader of the family, was held responsible for what happened in his family.  
Also, the original command to not eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was given to Adam, before Eve was created (Genesis 2:17)."

itcdmgb,No-Candy-5119,yapk3c,"Amen! Thank you.

Since Adam was not deceived (implications being: he knew exactly what was going on, he was a literal genius > God brought the animals to him for naming > God was the Word (John 1:1) and spoke using words that were equated with the the reality therein, so that means Adam must’ve understood the language of God AND the implications therein because he named all the animals in a way that was not arbitrary).

Therefore he knew exactly what was happening and the implications of the concept of death because God had previously told him death was the consequence of eating the fruit… and Adam allowed his wife to be the Guinea pig. It wasn’t passive sinning, it was monstrous. 

Referencing 2 Tim 2:14 we can therefore confirm this hypothesis on the simple basis that sinning while knowing full well the implications of the situation VERSUS being legitimately deceived, confirms Adam is FAR worse, and it’s very possible his wife was a test case in his abomination to test the veracity of the Lord.

But I'm glad I listened to God's confirmation and married him. That was just God's plan for both of us.

My husband was raised Catholic, but was Agnostic and borderline Athiest most of his teen/young adult life and when we met. He said he believed in a higher power, he just didnt know what it was. He was always open to learning about God and Christianity, but was real skeptical. He's a very logical person and wanted proof of God. 

While dating I always felt the urge to pray for him. I prayed for him constantly. I prayed that he would seek a relationship with Jesus, and for the Holy Spirit to impress on his heart and mind. Give him understanding and lead him to a relationship with Christ. All of my prayer was done quietly and in secret.

Since he was open to learning, we would have many conversations about religion, theology and Christianity.  I NEVER pressured him, or forced my beliefs on him. I wanted to just be faithful and let the Holy Spirit work if it was God's will for him. Our conversations challenged his unbelief and challenged my faith, too. He also had friends that were Christian and they would converse with him about it too.

Overtime, he slowly began to understand and accept Christianity and even went out and randomly bought himself a Bible! He would read it every night and we would have dicsussions. This surprised me, and I praised God for this faithfulness and the work of the Holy Spirit moving in his life. Still not pressuring him or anything. 

Before marrying him, I constantly sought God's confirmation that this was the man I was supposed to marry. I was a bit unsure because he wasn't Christian,  but God continued to say yes and I could see my husband's salvation working out in front of me, and so I married him. My husband fully surrendered and gave his life to Christ shortly before we were married and now he his committed to living a life that honors God. 

So, it's definitely possible, but I believe it depends on the person's heart and if they're open to receiving and willing to surrender to God."
itbnkrn,pikkdogs,yakpn7,"Well, the Bible says to not marry a non-Christian. If you become a Christian while you are married and your spouse doesn’t convert as well, then that’s another thing. But, you shouldn’t marry a non-Christian."
itbn4yu,crowned_glory_1966,yakpn7,My husband was raised Catholic. I converted to Catholicism in 1995 but left in 2012 left the church. On October 31 2015 I started attending my current spirit filled church and my life turned around. Hubby started attending this same church in August 2016 and has never looked back at the Catholic Church. We are now in a way better place both spiritually and in our marriage.
itbm7r7,ApostolicPrJ,yakpn7,"The simple answer here is that it is by the actions (activity in church events and faithfulness to teaching and tithes) of the Christian and the blessing that come of such faithfulness, that will show the non-Christian the positivity and benefits to being a Christian. That MAY (no guarantees) lead the non-Christian to following. At least that is how it happened for me."
itevllt,Rbrtwllms,yakpn7,"I am that spouse. My wife is a pastor's daughter. She met  *and* married me *while* I was an atheist. I remained an atheist for the next couple of years.

We ended up moving in with her parents for those years. 

We did pray and go to church as that's just what they did and I wasn't going to reinvent the wheel under their roof.

The nice thing was they were always open to answering any questions I had on the Bible, things about Christianity, etc, without shoving it down my throat. My FIL would even entertain my ""trick"" questions.

I decided one day to start reading the Bible cover to cover (a one year plan which I tackled in 6 months). I figured either I would better learn how to argue against it 
(showing the inconsistencies and fallacies within) and maybe even debunk it altogether, or find out it was true (if the evidence pointed that way).

I ended up testing/examining it in terms of history, philosophy, (consistency in) theology, science, etc. 

Also, once I decided to put my world view on the line (testing it by the same standards I was judging/critiquing Christianity by) in order to see or show that my world view holds up to those standards, turned out atheism didn't hold up as well as Christianity.

You're asking this to learn to have false hope in what God forbids. Your question leads to the free practice of this. It's common.

The Christians who do this do not find peace, joy or happiness. They will put on a front(if they show up to church at all) for various economic ($$$) reasons, but unanimously they reported a deep wound emotionally & spiritually, if by the grace of God they retain whatever they refer to as ""faith.""

The struggle is intense to date/marry someone with a nice attitude; but there's a real reason why we must not. It's like dating someone not commited to you. They're here today, possibly gone tomorrow, & you've pulled out all stops of expecting & including them in your life's end goals.

itemit7,KingMoomyMoomy,yb4bx4,"Armageddon doesn’t take place till Jesus returns. Yes Jesus partakes which is why it isn’t really a battle.  It’s one of the bowls of wrath.  God allows his enemies to be deceived by the antichrist to gather to make war on Him. Apparently they think they can win, probably because the antichrist was allowed to kill the two fire breathing prophets. They obviously won’t and don’t succeed. It’s a means of gathering the wicked to one place to pour out his wrath and wipe them out."
iteyuxi,AshenRex,yb4bx4,"For all those saying Revelation takes place in the future, prophecy has always been about what has happened, what is happening, and what is yet to happen. It’s speaking God’s truth to power and reality. Therefore, everything in Revelation can be interpreted as having already happened and as yet to happen. 

Much of the early church saw it as already having happened. Most modern “American/western conservative Christian’s” current understanding of Revelation is less than 150 years old."
iter4ax,Aditeuri,yb4bx4,"The battle of Armageddon is actually a figurative, literary comparitive reference to the Battle of Megiddo of 609 BCE where Pharaoh Necho II and his armies defeat Judah’s armies and see King Josiah fall in battle. The leaders and scribes of Judah took this as sudden and unexpected and it left a deep mark in subsequent centuries of Jewish history and theology. In many ways, the use of Armageddon in Rev. John is a Christian reference to this cultural tragedy, but inverting Josiah’s unexpected defeat to become his descendant, Jesus’ ultimate victory.

Think of the use of Armageddon in a similar way to how we might make cultural references to similarly epochal historical events such as “crossing the Rubicon” or “Waterloo”."

Same can be said of other prophetic and apocalyptic writings like Enoch, deutero- and trito-Isaiah, 2 Baruch, Rev.

irnooc0,Siantlark,xzp0rd,"Graham Priest is a contemporary philosopher and logician who edited a book on fighting and philosophy called Beating and Nothingness: Martial Arts and Philosophy that you might want to look at. It covers things like philosophy of aesthetics applied to combat sports, Aristotelian ethics in western chivalric traditions, the epistemology of physical contact, etc. 

Soho Takuan's Annals of the Sword Taia is good to look at for the justification behind killing ""without killing"" and is influential in general for later Japanese, especially Zen Buddhist, fighters and thinkers to justify violence and murder against others. Brian Victoria in particular argues that Takuan's argument tying together the Buddhist doctrine of anatta, the non-existence or permanence of the self, and detachment from material desire with violence planted the ideological roots of the Imperial Japanese militarism of World War 2 by absolving soldiers and samurai of their actions and allowing them to empty themselves into a vessel for their superiors to command. 

There's a recent anthology of essays looking at the intersection between MMA and philosophy of sports and martial arts called The Philosophy of Mixed Martial Arts: Squaring the Octagon that you should look at. It covers things like the relationship between MMA and the various styles that make up MMA training, the value of ethics and sportsmanship in the ring, etc."

He makes a very general statement about some aspect of martial arts in a paragraph (mostly something like ""you must act according to The Way""), then concludes with ""this is difficult to state in words"" or ""you must study this deeply"".

Mushashi is a great folk hero and fighter to be sure, but a deep thinker and writer he is not.  For better more in depth philosophical and martial advice, I would recommend ""The Life Giving Sword"" by Yagyu Munenori, a fencing master to the Shogun.  As well as ""Unfettered Mind"" by Takuan Soho, famous Zen monk, who was thought to be Musashi's tutor in some telling of Musashi's story.

My response: I don't believe there are any ""books on martial arts philosophy that everyone should read."" Different people practice martial arts for different reasons, so different books would be relevant.

The main reason I practice martial arts is self-defense, and self-defense is my primary focus when teaching. Thus, the books I recommend to my students are works such as 'The Gift of Fear,' 'Meditations on Violence,' and so on. Many of my students are women, and I honestly don't think Musashi Miyamoto is especially relevant to a 21st century woman worried about sexual assault. 

Personally, while I've read martial works such as 'The Art of War,' 'The Book of Five Rings,' and 'The Hagakure,' the effect on me has been fairly minimal. I entertain no fantasies of being a samurai or other ancient warrior. More general works of philosophy — Buddha, Lao Tzu, Friedrich Nietzsche, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, etc. — have impacted me and my life far more."

In this case the word is minas which was worth about 3 months wage so 10 minas would be a laborer's earnings from nearly three years work."
itenabb,MuskieGo,yay8sn,"I would recommend reading Matthew 25 where the parable is recorded as well. Jesus will leave and we are charged to be faithful until his return. I think your question boils down to: ""Be faithful with what?"" I would give two answers. 

He has given us all the same charge, recorded in scripture, make disciples, love one another, abide in him. This is analogous to the charge of the master to make more money.

To accomplish this, we have various levels of ability, opportunity, and even time on earth. These are not ours,they are given by God. These are analogous to the minas/talents. I would caution against extending the parable too far in the direction of making more money.

The judgement may be the judgement in 1 Cor 3:10-13 for believers. Although the severity of the judgement may indicate that the unfaithful servant was never a follower and would thus be the eternal judgement for nonbelievers. I would lean toward the first."

GENESIS 1

The Beginning

1In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.

3And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. 4God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. 5God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.

6And God said, “Let there be a vault between the waters to separate water from water.” 7So God made the vault and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. 8God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.

9And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so. 10God called the dry ground “land,” and the gathered waters he called “seas.” And God saw that it was good.

11Then God said, “Let the land produce vegetation: seed-bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it, according to their various kinds.” And it was so. 12The land produced vegetation: plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good. 13And there was evening, and there was morning—the third day.

14And God said, “Let there be lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night, and let them serve as signs to mark sacred times, and days and years, 15and let them be lights in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth.” And it was so. 16God made two great lights—the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night. He also made the stars. 17God set them in the vault of the sky to give light on the earth, 18to govern the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God saw that it was good. 19And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.

20And God said, “Let the water teem with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the vault of the sky.” 21So God created the great creatures of the sea and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good. 22God blessed them and said, “Be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas, and let the birds increase on the earth.” 23And there was evening, and there was morning—the fifth day.

24And God said, “Let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds: the livestock, the creatures that move along the ground, and the wild animals, each according to its kind.” And it was so. 25God made the wild animals according to their kinds, the livestock according to their kinds, and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds. And God saw that it was good.

26Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground.”

27So God created mankind in his own image,

in the image of God he created them;

male and female he created them.

28God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”

29Then God said, “I give you every seed-bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it. They will be yours for food. 30And to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds in the sky and all the creatures that move along the ground—everything that has the breath of life in it—I give every green plant for food.” And it was so.

31God saw all that he had made, and it was very good. And there was evening, and there was morning—the sixth day."

it79187,ArchaicChaos,y9lc12,"Ecclesiastes is my favourite OT book because I used to do a lot of existentialist philosophy. Basically, no matter what you can do in life, it has no meaning unless you live for God. It's very well elaborated. That being said, I recommend reading all the wisdom literature including the apocryphal ones. Sirach and Solomon. 

The most important thing to do when reading the OT is to see the shadows of Jesus in it. That's really the point. The revelation of the new covenant is the Holy Spirit. The spirit cannot be quantified, but the physical appearance of it is the old law, you could say. The spirit is like a great object in the sky that we can't see and the old law is the shadow it casts on the ground that we can see. So when we read the old laws about what a Levitical Priest must do to be clean to enter into God's presence, understand that this is a shadow of how we must be washed clean in baptism and be sinless to have the holy spirit, God's presence, in us. When you read about Joseph being sold into slavery by his brothers in Egypt and then being raised to the throne over them, see that this is a typology of Israel and Christ. See that when Abraham is about to offer up Isaac as a sacrifice and God provides the replacement ram, that is Christ taking our sin and death on for us. When you read about Israel wandering outside of the promised land for 40 years waiting to get in, realize that this is us, waiting to enter the kingdom of God. That's really the main point of the OT as it has now been revealed."
it6tn2o,Herosandicons,y9lc12,"As far as stories go, I am not sure I would call it a favorite as it's not really very pretty, but I found the story of the time Saul sought out the witch of Endor, very interesting and fascinating.

Was also fascinated by the fact that when Saul was essentially going crazy with anxiety , + jealousy of David, he would actually call on David to play and sing for him and it was the only thing that would settle Saul when he was in the throes of anxiety.

Actually, the whole story of Saul, David and Jonathan was interesting and fascinating to me.

When I first started reading in the Bible, I was surprised that there were quite a few interesting and even exciting stories in it that were actually as good as anything we use to entertain ourselves in the modern world of movies, sports, and games etc.

 It was also surprising to me to learn that all those people who I had ignorantly thought of before as 'stuffy old bearded boring guys who tended sheep', were actually as human as we are with problems, sins,  temptations,loves and lives, wants and needs, etc

I think many people who have never read the bible would be as fascinated and surprised as I was.

itcl4yz,rbibleuser,y9lc12,">Can you explain just a little more. I’ll study for myself but could you point me in the direction you’re talking about?

The Tabernacle is a picture of Jesus. Its dimensions map to many other parts of the text, especially in the throne-room visions, for example: ""I was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told, “Go and measure the temple of God and the altar, with its worshipers. But exclude the outer court; do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles."" (Rev. 11:1,2a) Notice that John is given a measuring-rod and he is told what to measure, and what not to measure. So, we see that measuring is also a kind of judgement (1 Pet. 4:17, Matt. 19:28) -- the Gentiles are excluded because they are outside of the church/temple (not subject to it), and the courtyard is given over to them. If you continue reading, you also see that the Gentiles will trample the courtyard ""for 42 months"", which is the length of the Great Tribulation under the Beast. So, the measurements are not just spatial dimensions, they are also time-spans. Thus, the Old Testament tabernacle and temple, for which we have extremely detailed measurements, are not just recorded out of boredom or obsession. They are, in a sense, the **templ**ate of this world-age, and all prophetic structure -- including the incarnation, death and resurrection of Jesus! -- is contained within them. Some of it we can figure out just by drawing these kinds of connection within the text, but much of it still remains sealed up in the scroll which the lamb unseals in Rev. 6 and following..."

irdluac,DilutedFlower,xxrhma,"This is me as well. I can switch from loving someone to immediately being suspicious so quickly. It does become very lonely. A lot of the times I ask myself ""why am I feeling this way?"" ""What's making me feel this way?"" ""Did something happen to trigger these emotions?"" It kinda puts everything into perspective sometimes though sometimes the emotions get the best of me and I can't control it. A lot of the times I do simple things that play a video game or watch YouTube to feel less lonely. I know that probably won't really help cause they are kinda small things. It's ok to feel how you feel. That took me forever to realize but the question now is how to cope with it. I also tend to be pretty up front about my emotions with people. It clears things up with the right people that are willing to listen and solve everything. I've also been working on my expectations with people. I don't wanna put too many expectations or pressure on people as everyone is different and won't be able to follow through with everything. Hopefully this helps or gives some sort of perspective.

irhy1wl,ginger_sprout,xymvmf,"Suboxone is used for opiate/heroin addiction, and it's a bit controversial even for that. Different drugs do different things in the brain, and opiate addiction is not the same thing as alcohol addiction. (Although, this doesn't mean that having an addiction to one drug means that other drugs are ""safe"" to use, I learned that one the hard way.) I've never heard of anyone being prescribed Suboxone for alcohol cravings and I'd be mega cautious about going down that route even if a doctor was willing to prescribe it. I've known a couple of people in recovery whose drug of choice is heroin, and they've described taking Suboxone as basically just, hm, what they described was that they still got a high from taking it, and then they ended up going back to heroin before getting sober later. It sounds to me like Suboxone might just introduce a whole nother can of worms to the equation.

Seeing a doctor who's experienced with using medication to treat alcohol dependence is probably the best bet if you're interested in going the medication route. Alcohol has a pretty complicated effect on the brain. There is a subreddit dedicated to using medication for alcoholism treatment, which might have more information about things, but yeah, it's not something where there's a drug that just basically works for everyone.

For what it's worth, naltrexone is the drug that's commonly used for alcohol cravings, as far as I know. I tried using it while drinking (called the Sinclair Method) some years ago and it wasn't the game changer that I hoped it would be. Benzos are less commonly prescribed longer term these days after people have detoxed from alcohol because that's another way to create a new problem, and I do have experience with that as well, and I don't recommend it. You couldn't pay me to take benzos now. 

Getting active in my recovery was more beneficial for me and worked a whole lot better than taking medication did, but I had to get there by trying to find other ways to do it first, and I don't know. I'm sure that medication is helpful for some people, if you think that it might be helpful and your doctor is on board and providing direction and guidance with how to use it, it might be worth trying it out and seeing what happens."
iri8vpp,ThomasM219,xymvmf,"Hey, I’m 7 months sober and have tried Naltrexone (Vivitrol) never heard of the Topamax. Looks like an anti seizure medication. Probably helpful if you’re cold turkey detoxing a lot but probably would do nothing for cravings.

No doctor in there right mind would prescribe you Suboxone. It’s not designed as an anti craving drug. It’s a maintenance drug for opiate addiction. Commonly used to taper people off from heroin/prescription opiates once they are in a treatment centre. Think going to a doctor and asking for methadone lol.

I know some people on Suboxone and the side effects are not great. Looks like hell. Most people cannot wait to get off it.

My experience with naltrexone was very bad. I still drank but obviously just got the negative side effects of drinking. So I just stopped taking it. Was a horrible time. Naltrexone works by blocking the release of dopamine we get from drinking. In theory is good but I don’t know anyone that it’s worked for.

The other common anti craving drug is Camparal. Supposed to help with cravings but did nothing for me. Works differently to naltrexone.


My experience has been that the only thing that worked for me was a 12 step based rehab then living the steps. I wasted years and thousands of dollars on medications, psychologist and psychiatrists.

But yeah in terms of dealing with cravings, that changes depending on how long you’ve been sober. The first few months I just distracted myself with anything I could (exercise, online chess, walks, cleaning, sport.) Now I deal with it by playing forward what picking up a drink will do to me and keeping active. I found they became easier to deal with when I was able to trust myself to be out and about. Cravings don’t last forever sometimes you just have to remind yourself why you’re doing it! Got to break those delusion of drinking down!"
irll9sk,Embarrassed-Mix-6711,xymvmf,"What the hell kind of doctor would suggest suboxone for alcohol?! I would stop seeing them . I worked at a suboxone/methadone clinic and it is no joke. People have overdosed on it in the waiting room before.
I would recommend naltrexone! Apparently the ‘sinclair’ method works well. I havent tried it myself because my benefits dont cover it and its kinda pricey."
irlgfs0,BeautifulMoonClear,xymvmf,Vivitrol works for me. I don’t drink on it.
irhydvs,NotConnor365,xymvmf,"Yeah I am active in my recovery but things have gotten more difficult recently. I hear a lot of people in 12 step meetings saying suboxone keeps them from craving most drugs, but especially opiates and alcohol. There are definitely doctors in my city that prescribe it for that purpose but I also don't want to get addicted to opiates in the process, so you made some pretty good points."
iri19vk,SingleServUsername,xymvmf,"Just wanted to add... Nalaxone does not directly act on cravings, it blocks the reward pathway so that when you drink, you don't associate the beverage with good feelings. The Sinclair Method requires participants to continue drinking, over time weakening the association between the drink and the buzz. At first (and if you don't continue drinking at least for a little while), the cravings will be exactly the same."
irii5ne,NotConnor365,xymvmf,Nobody will prescribe me Campral for some reason. I guess I never drank enough - at least that's what doctors have told me. I would try it if I had the chance.
irlleo8,Embarrassed-Mix-6711,xymvmf,Also suboxone is highly addictive! Naltrexone is not at all
irjkk0d,ginger_sprout,xymvmf,"I get that. I've gotten sober several times and found that being active in a 12 step program is the only way that I'm able to maintain my sobriety, but I've struggled with doing that in different ways at different times along the way. And the end result has always been that I go back to my own way of doing things and my own solutions, and that has led to relapse and more struggle and pain. 

My experience has been, as someone who's had experience both with staying sober and not staying sober, that when I'm moving forward with taking action in working a recovery program, I'm able to keep going and stay sober. When I stop taking action to move forward, staying sober becomes more of a struggle until I don't. Going to meetings, in my experience, is enough at first to help me keep moving forward. When it's a different action to go to meetings and hear different things and talk to different people, that's enough. But if I don't keep moving forward along the path by getting a sponsor and working the steps, after a while meetings stop being enough.

The steps work by removing the mental obsession with the idea of drinking and using for us. The steps clear out a lot of the barriers to having an effective spiritual experience and allow us to live in a way where the idea of drinking or using just stops being appealing. If you're already going to meetings it's worth giving that a shot because that's something that has been effective for me and a lot of other people, and then I didn't have to struggle with the obsession and come up with my own solution for how I felt and the desire to escape myself and my life through alcohol or other drugs.

Keep going. Sending hugs. 💜"

Nope, I got akathisia from jjst one 25mg tablet. According to this paper, turns out it does screw your brain chemistry up completely: https://tidsskriftet.no/en/2019/09/kronikk/quetiapine-not-sleeping-pill"
ipwqzhb,J1986tn,xo36i3,I take haloperidol. It takes away my positive symptoms. It makes me slow..
iq05ti1,J1930,xo36i3,I hate haldol. Dinosaur med. tons of side effects. I like the newer generation antipsychotics much better
ipwwxp7,Austin0558,xo36i3,"Haldol is so old school and can have bad lasting effects, it didn’t do anything for me but I’d rather be on the newer meds like Saphris, Invega, Seroquel is great for sleep, and so on."
ipxx231,mrniceguy167,xo36i3,"Yes. During my first major psychotic break, I was administered a really high dose of fluanxol intravenously and experienced the absolute worst and painful side effects of my life. Few days later, I experienced appalling extrapyramidal side effects. My back was contorted, spine had a valley shaped ""dent"" in it. My arms were raising by themselves. Neck was twisting to the side uncontrollably. Eyes rolled into their sockets.

I was rushed to the ER where they tried multiple drugs until they found the ""antidote"" to the drug I was given. Never want to try an atypical neuroleptic after that experience again!"

ipx5y08,victorioushermit,xo36i3,"I take haldol with invega. Haldol on it's own is very sedating for me and causes serious cognitive problems. With invega the cognitive problems go away and the haldol effectively treats my positive symptoms. I will say, though, that I have quite a few side effects from it, but all APs come with side effects. Overall typical antipsychotics are worth trying if you've been struggling to find an atypical AP that works for you . They do come with potential side effects like any other med, and are more likely to cause TD, but they are a godsend if you respond well to them."

I used to take 20 mg/day as my daily antipsychotic.  I don't take it anymore because my doctor and I were both kinda worried about tardive dyskinesthia (dude idk I never spell that right and I'm too lazy to look it up lol sorry).  I still have 5-10 mg to use as a PRN when I need it and it works really well and quickly for me."

ipwtc4k,NotConnor365,xo36i3,Was this from haloperidol (Haldol) or another medication?
iq06b8d,J1930,xo36i3,Haldol doesn't typically cause that. It's more likely to cause tardive dyskinesia. Youre thinking of lamictal that can cause Steven Johnson's syndrome... but that's really not common
ipwtj6q,J1986tn,xo36i3,I don't know what caused the blurry vision or burning feeling. I'm on benztropine too..

29 And also on My menservants and on My maidservants

Blood and fire and pillars of smoke.*

Zechariah 9:14 *Then the Lord will be seen over them, And His arrow will go forth like lightning. The Lord God will blow the trumpet, And go with whirlwinds from the south.*

Luke 10:18-20 *And He said to them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. 19 Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you. 20 Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven.”*

Luke 21:11 *And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful sights and great signs from heaven.*

John 14:26 *But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.*

Is the most obvious one. Scorpions, spiders, and stinging insects all leaving you untouched, and being trodden under your feet bespeaks a great overcoming of evil.

Hiding in cracks and darkness would be indicative of these powers working in the dark, and trying to conceal their influence; but ultimately being brought to light.

The lights in the sky and the scrolls could indicate angels or messengers of God, and the scroll a blessing; the context of praying over your family and anointing them (a kind of consecrating or setting them apart to God) would seem to support this.

The following of the spiders leaving your house would indicate a great victory, wherein (the power of God having moved in) the power of darkness is cast out; and driven from you. 

All in all this speaks to a coherent ongoing increase in your life of closeness to God and separation from evil. You're quite blessed."
it5ntss,PACKmanMixr,y946jg,The Lord works in ways unbeknownst to us. Perhaps it is a vision of the prophets. Pray for knowledge and ask the Holy Spirit to bless you with the knowledge of understanding your visions. God Bless You!
it6zull,DreamGirl3,y946jg,"It sounds like the dreams me and my family have been having.

I had a dream at the beginning of the year where I and my family were in a tall skyscraper and  we were in a corner apartment at the back of the building. The two corner walls were glass. Out of these window we could see the city. To the left of the city was the ocean and behind the city was mountains. Suddenly, a MASSIVE tornado came through the city and began destroying buildings. At first, my family and I were scared. It was coming down the street toward our bulding quickly. We gathered up some things and hunkered down in the living room where the windows were. We knew we wouldn't get out of the building in time so we stayed where we were and chose to wait until the storm passed. As the tornado passed our building, we heard it's winds roaring and we felt it sucking the front of the building. We heard things being swept away by the wind. The building swayed. But we (including the apartment) stayed safe. Even our electricity continued to work. 

As soon as the first tornado hit, another came, coming along the same street as the one before it. Then another, and another, and another. Tornado after tornado came, each getting slightly smaller than the other. There were over 10 (I believe 12). Each tornado ripped apart businesses, parts of the city, etc. leaving behind ruin and fire. But we were not afraid. We just sat and watched them come, as if we were watching a performance or show. Finally, the last left and we got up from the floor where we were sitting. The city was in ruins. Buildings were destroyed and on fire. But the sun glistened beautifully off the ocean and the mountains stood majestically. 

We walked out of the building to see what had been destroyed. To our shock, the entire front of our building was ripped off. But we, along with many other people, were safe. We went back upstairs and looked out the apartment windows again. The sun was setting over the mountains and it was the most beautiful sunset I had ever seen. And what was odd was the fires from the buildings added to the beauty of it all. 

The next day after having my dream, I wondered if tornados were in the Bible. It turns out, yes, they are spoken about just called something different:

**Jeremiah 30:23**
*Behold the storm of the Lord! Wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest; it will burst upon the heads of the wicked.*

**Ezekial 13:13**
*Therefore thus says the Lord God: I will make a stormy wind break out in my wrath, and there shall be a deluge of rain in my anger, and great hailstones in wrath to make a full end.*

**Nahum 1:3**
*The Lord is slow to anger and great in power, and the Lord will by no means clear the guilty. His way is in whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.*

Basically, the interpretation God gave us was that the enemy (Satan and those who serve him and his ways) has been pushing his plans throughout the earth. There have evil things hidden for a long time. These evil schemes are hurting people and causing death. But God has heard our cries and our prayers. The Lord is VERY angry at the evil that is going on. So He is enacting His plans to thwart the schemes of the enemy. 

Justice from Heaven is raining down. As this happens, it will look scary to us. But God is using these incidents to expose and upheave the enemy and his plans. Rest in knowing that you, God's people, are safe. Cling to Him and trust in His timing. He will bring you through all of this. As God told me, ""Just sit back and enjoy the show."" 

In the same way, God may be telling you that scary or unsettling things in your life are getting ready to happen. You may see and find evil exposed in places you didn't expect. The enemy may try to attack you, your family, and those you love. But don't worry as you and your family will be protected by Him. The key is to stay close to God, pray and study His Word, and listen to what He says. He will keep you and your family (and those you love) safe. He will show you what to do and how to deal with each situation that comes. 

I hope that helps! I'm sorry you've been going through so much. I will be praying for you and your family. Stay strong by relying on God even when it doesn't make sense. You got this! 🤗💕"
italoib,KingMoomyMoomy,y946jg,"I always encourage one to exercise caution with dreams because many people use them to lead others astray, and there seem to be warnings in scripture that people can be led astray by their own dreams.  Seducing spirits can do these things. 

“Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones. But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, “The Lord rebuke you.” But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively.”
‭‭Jude‬ ‭1‬:‭8‬-‭10‬ ‭ESV‬‬

But all that said, your dreams do seem to have some very biblical end times imagery in them. And unless you were already familiar with some of these passages and just manifested them in your thoughts, some of them seem to line up. So, study the scriptures old and New Testament. Especially prophetic books of the OT and see if God will give you meaning through them. You might be surprised. He can give understanding to whomever he wishes, but it has to fit the totality of scripture and not just loosely applied images to leverage strange doctrines or prophecy."

it3o55i,JaladHisArmsWide,y955w8,"The *best* resource for this would be copies of the Nestle Aland NT (whether in Greek alone or with a Greek Latin combo.) In the margins, it tries to list *all* of the possible references that could be being made. Even if it is only a remote connection, it will drop the reference to the Tanakh, the Deuterocanon, or the other Second Temple literature the text could be referencing.

Otherwise, certain translations will be pretty good at putting references in footnotes (like the ESV-CE or the NLT. They will often only cite direct references (the text literally quoting another text), so some of the references will go unnoticed (or intentionally ignored, for example Hebrews 11:34b and 2 Maccabees 7); but most of the time the big things will get mentioned.

Otherwise, a good study Bible can be your friend"

it3o1qg,ArchaicChaos,y955w8,">I was reading Luke 4:1-12, where Jesus and the devil quote scripture at each other, and none of the Bibles I have looked at have footnotes saying exactly where they are quoting from. 

Try a *study* Bible. Regular Bible's usually have very few footnotes, study Bible's have a lot. Try the NET study Bible or the Zondervan NIV. 

What you're more looking for is a cross reference Bible. Which will give you a small note on what scripture this crosses to in the OT as well as other verses that use similar language. 

But Bible commentaries are very good. I am in the process of writing one myself. I write little articles here and there. I recently wrote a bit on Hebrews 1 and 2 for Reddit here. If you read this, the Hebrews writer makes a ton of OT quotations and doesn't tell you where he gets any of them from. For example, Hebrews 1:6 ""let all God's angels worship him."" There's debate on where he's quoting from. Is it a Psalm, or Deuteronomy? If you read my posts on it, you'll see how this is developed. Reading commentaries will give you the same kind of feel. So that's kind of the short answer to your post. Cross references or Bible commentaries. 

>If not, do you think it’s important to have the exact context, or do you think the NT writers have all the context we’d need?

Yes it's important. No, the NT itself isn't like another Bible. We have a very wraped view of the NT honestly. We act like Matthew was consulting Paul's letters and John's gospel as he was writing his gospel. No. That wasn't going on. 

>Would the early church members know scripture well enough that they’d get the references?

Most of what we would call ""early church fathers"" would know, yes. But, a lot of the early members, no. They wouldn't have a clue. Many heard if Jesus and never read an OT before and certainly not any Jewish literature."

The context is everything. So important.

> Would the early church members know scripture well enough that they’d get the references?

Some of them, absolutely. Not all would have been lettered, but many of them were. The NT writers absolutely assumed their audiences would ""get it"", meaning, the lettered/clergy would get the references and explain them to the unlettered/laity.

> What about the gentiles? How do you personally go about understanding the connections between the OT and the NT when the writers/speakers in the NT directly quote?

Saturation. The key is to get saturated in both Old and New Testament so that you basically have a ""feel"" for when the NT author is citing/quoting/referencing something in the OT."

Now a bleeding nose and cutting up vegetables have nothing to do with the Halloween series but for the majority of us we just get it the joke.  We get the reference. 

Well the Jewish people in the New Testament also had a firm grasp on the stories of the tanakh. A word study can help. Such as why did Jesus breath the Holy Spirit on the apostles prior to Pentecost? 

Well it goes back to genesis 2. 

Genesis 2:7
New American Standard Bible
7 Then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living person.

There is even a connection to genesis 1. 

As for the wind, it’s the same word as for spirit. But that’s deeper than I care to go into .

Anyways you’ll notice that the connection is there even though it’s nuanced. 

Another example is the “ he will be called Immanuel “ in the New Testament. The hyperlink to that is way out of immediate context. It’s about a war that happened way before the birth of Christ by a young woman. They turn that into a story of Christ born of a virgin. 

I suggest using “ The Bible Project” app."

Also in that separate smaller window there's a button you can hit to bring up that whole chapter of the verse that's being cross-referenced that way you can read the surrounding context of what's being quoted or you can read the whole chapter of the Old Testament that's being quoted. You can easily close the smaller window and get back to where you were reading. I can very quickly bring up 5 6 10 or all of the cross references that are being quoted or alluded to and read just those verses or the whole chapter and get back to the original New Testament verse in chapter that I was on and it makes Bible surfing very easy and convenient.

The app also has a built in interlinear, dictionary, commentaries and strong concordance that gives you definition of Greek and Hebrew words and even gives you a small audio sample of how to say those words with the click of a button.

The app also has an amazing search feature. If you can only remember one word from a verse you can use the search feature to search the English word and it will bring up every time that word is used and you can even filter the results by individual book, NT only, OT only. For example I was thinking about that first and talking about it with a friend the other day: ""be wise as serpents and gentle as doves"" ... so I use the search button and filtered it to the Book of Matthew only and typed in Serpent and was able to find it quickly.

Also the app has it built-in where you can copy and paste a single verse the whole chapter or a certain set of verses in that chapter to your clipboard very easily.

I can't say enough good things about the app and it's totally free and it has a ton of versions of the Bible translations. Give it a try!"

it3rpr7,harmonybobcat,y955w8,"I might disagree with your last point- during the earliest period, the (majority Jewish) readers of the NT absolutely would’ve been tracking with the citations of the Old Testament - otherwise, the authors wouldn’t have likely seen fit to quote it in the first place. You’ll notice in Paul’s speeches in Acts to non-Jewish individuals, he doesn’t really cite scripture at all. But in the Pauline letters and gospel accounts, it’s everywhere. Not to mention, if you read Clement of Rome, holy cow- that guy cited Isaiah like it was going out of style. These people knew their audience.

In fact, I’d say this is almost central to understanding the Bible. All these references and callbacks can seem cryptic or mysterious to us now, but it wasn’t meant to be so to its original readers (this was in stark contrast to the Gnostic writings which focused on transcendental, abstract, unknowable ideas). So it’s very important that if we want to be good readers of the New Testament, we should make an attempt to put ourselves in the shoes of it’s original, Old Testament-literate audience.

it3uvy2,harmonybobcat,y955w8,Fair enough. I’m sorry I misunderstood. Perhaps I’m still just not sure where they idea comes from that Jesus’ followers had never read or heard Jewish writings?
it3vme9,ArchaicChaos,y955w8,"No worries. By the time John began writing his gospel, the almost exclusively Jewish church became predominately gentile. As a result, you find certain oddities in John's gospel, for example, his explaining what Jewish phrases meant, or basic Jewish landmarks in his gospel which every Jew would know. You find his use of ""the logos"" being incredibly tailored to a gentile audience for the sake of inclusion. By the time we get to the 2nd century, you had mass amounts of gentiles who never were Jewish, never under the old law, never knew of these ceremonial laws, never read the OT, being told about Jesus and the kingdom. They got baptized and believed but didn't know the OT background that much. They had to learn it. This is why the problem of proselytizing was so rampant for so long as well. ""Jesus was a jew so why don't we become one too?"" It was new and exciting to them.

Today, 2000 years later, we see that Christianity is very very much inclined towards gentiles obviously. But, thanks to our ""bibles"" being a stitching together of Christian and Jewish literature, we get both as a bit of a package deal. For a very long time, this wasn't the case for Christians. I hope I clarified myself a bit better."
it3y1hl,harmonybobcat,y955w8,"Good stuff re: John. I’ve been reading thru that lately and it’s definitely striking how much explaining John does. If I can press into that out of my own curiosity- do you have any thoughts on why John extrapolates certain Jewish background details, but then in other cases lets them remain “assumed”? Example might be “born of water and spirit” in ch3 being a (somewhat cryptic if you’re unaware) reference to Ezekiel 36, or in ch7 “If anyone thirsts” being a reference to the Feast of Tabernacles, and the water provided to Israel in the desert. Just curious since this is stuff I’m coming across in real time.

Slightly related, I recently heard someone explain that the logos/word carried equal significance to post-exile Jews, because of the “memra” tradition in the Targums, which develop the idea of the Word of the Lord as being a person distinct from God but still being addressed as YHWH. Super interesting."

is7dyst,JaKrispy72,y330dh,"I am assuming you are speaking of the angels noted in Revelation 2 and 3.  Follow this from the beginning of Revelation:  God is the Alpha and Omega.  He has now given all authority to the now fully revealed (Revelation) Jesus Christ.  Jesus has in his hand, seven stars. And there are seven lampstands.  It explicitly states the stars are angels and the lampstands are the churches.  Jesus has a message for the angels.  Jesus lays out what he expects from that particular church.  If they overcome, reward is given.  If they fail, the lampstand is removed. The best way to interpret this is to see the angels as the messenger (literal meaning) or the leader/pastor of that church.  Not as an angelic being, which would not make sense.  Jesus uses the Holy Spirit and these letters from John to these churches as a way to correct or encourage each church.  John the Baptist was referred to being an ""angelos"" or messenger in Mt 11:10, so there is precedence for this type of interpretation as well as it is what makes the most sense.  This is not to be understood as some chronology following the church throughout history either.  These are pitfalls that any church could fall into.  A current church may have many errors as well.  And may have an error not listed here explicitly.  Jesus tells them how to correct what is wrong in the church, and the messenger/pastor is responsible for delivering that message to the congregation.  The star represents the angel/messenger to the church.  This Revelation from John would have gone out to all churches and to all believers.  If you are saved, then you have the Holy Spirit; which means you would have an ""ear"" for what the Spirit is saying."
is75yih,Shorts28,y330dh,"We are not told a name, and therefore we don't know who he/she/angelic is. Kittel says ""The angel of the church is a messenger and instrument of God (Rev. 1.16, 20; 2.1; 3.1)."""
is7supx,digital_angel_316,y330dh,"Pulpit Commentary Revelation 1: Verse 20. - \[Edit: Melchizedekian versus Office Holder\] 

The mystery. In construction this is the accusative after ""write."" A mystery is the opposite of a revealed truth; it is a sacred truth kept secret, the inner meaning of something which is perceived, but not generally understood.

The angels of the seven Churches. The meaning of these ""angels"" has been very much disputed. The common explanation that they are the bishops of the Churches is attractive on account of its simplicity. But it has very grave difficulties, especially for those who assign the Apocalypse to the earlier date of A.D. . It is highly improbable that at that very early time the seven Churches were already so fully organized as each to possess its own bishop. And granting that they were, and that the bishops might fitly be called ""angels"" or ""messengers,"" would they not be called messengers of God or of Christ, rather than messengers of the Churches""? And would not the primitive Church have preserved this title as a synonym for ""bishop""? ""

St. John's own language gives the true key to the symbolism. 'The seven stars are the angels of the seven Churches, and the seven candlesticks are the seven Churches.' This contrast between the heavenly and the earthly fires - the star shining steadily by its own inherent eternal light, and the lamp flickering and uncertain, requiring to be fed with fuel and tended with care - cannot be devoid of meaning. The star is the suprasensual counterpart, the heavenly representative; the lamp, the earthly realization, the outward embodiment. Whether the angel is here conceived as an actual person, the celestial guardian, or only as a personification, the idea or spirit of the Church, it is unnecessary for my present purpose to consider.

But whatever may be the exact conception, he is identified with and made responsible for the Church to a degree wholly unsuited to any human officer. Nothing is predicated of him which may not be predicated of it. To him are imputed all its hopes, its fears, its graces, its shortcomings, he is punished with it, and he is rewarded with it ... Nor is this mode of representation new. The 'princes' in Daniel (Daniel 10:13, 20, 21) present a very near if not an exact parallel to the angels of the Revelation"" (Bishop Lightfoot, 'Philippians,' p. 198).

The identification of the angel of each Church with the Church itself is shown in a marked way by the fact that, although each epistle is addressed to the angel, yet the constantly recurring refrain is, ""Hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches,"" not ""to the angels of the Churches."" The angel and the Church are the same under different aspects: the one is its spiritual character personified; the other is the congregation of believers who collectively possess this character."

is6qwev,nickshattell,y330dh,"In the most general sense, the noun “angel”derives from the root meaning specifically ""to send with a message”. 

God is Good itself (Mark 10:18) and Truth itself (John 14:6). So that which is sent to Pergamum would be describing the quality of the church. The subsequent verses provide insight into these qualities, for example, that they “remain true to God’s Name” (verse 13) but also “a few things against” them (verse 14). 

In other words it is describing the goods and truths with the church. God’s Name represents all of these Divine Qualities in the One True God, whereas the “angel of Pergamum” would refer to things of God’s Name (Good and Truth itself, or Love and Wisdom) sent to Pergamum, or with Pergamum - both specifically in literal time and in the eternal sense of the whole."

Paul explicitly tells the Thessalonians that the Antichrist (""the man of lawlessness"") comes before Jesus comes to gather the saints:

# 2 Thessalonians 2:1-8

^(1) Now **concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him**, we ask you, brothers, ^(2) not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come. ^(3) Let no one deceive you in any way. **For that day will not come, unless the rebellion** \[*the apostasy—apostasia in Greek*\] **comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed**, the son of destruction, ^(4) who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God. ^(5) Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things? ^(6) And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time. ^(7) For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way. ^(8) And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming.

The Antichrist will reign for a period of 3½ years, where he is permitted to persecute the saints, a period referred to as the Great Tribulation, and when Jesus returns, he defeats the Antichrist.

# Revelation 13:1-10

^(1) And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads. ^(2) And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority. ^(3) One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast. ^(4) And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?”

^(5) And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, **and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.** ^(6) It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven. ^(7) **Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them.** And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation, ^(8) and all who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain. ^(9) If anyone has an ear, let him hear:

^(10) If anyone is to be taken captive,  
to captivity he goes;  
if anyone is to be slain with the sword,  
with the sword must he be slain.

Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.

# Revelation 7:9-14

^(9) After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands, ^(10) and crying out with a loud voice, “Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!” ^(11) And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, ^(12) saying, “Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen.”

^(13) Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, “Who are these, clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?” ^(14) I said to him, “Sir, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

# Revelation 19:11-20

^(11) Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war. ^(12) His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself. ^(13) **He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God.** ^(14) And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses. ^(15) From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty. ^(16) **On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.**

^(17) Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, “Come, gather for the great supper of God, ^(18) to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great.” ^(19) And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army. ^(20) **And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.**

In fact, Jesus explicitly says that he returns after the Great Tribulation to gather the elect.

# Matthew 24:15-22, 29-31

^(15) “So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), ^(16) then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. ^(17) Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, ^(18) and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. ^(19) And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! ^(20) Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. ^(21) **For then there will be great tribulation**, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. ^(22) And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. ...

... ^(29) **“Immediately after the tribulation** of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. ^(30) **Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.** ^(31) **And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.**

John then records what he sees: “I looked, and there before me was a white horse!

He is the false imitator of the true Christ, who is also associated with a white horse (Revelation 19:11–16). At the beginning of the tribulation, the Antichrist will be given authority (“a crown”), and he will wage war (“a bow”), conquering all who oppose him. This description agrees with Daniel’s vision of the “little horn” that rises to power and is bent on conquest: “This horn was waging war against the holy people and defeating them” (Daniel 7:21; cf. Revelation 13:7). Jesus comes after this to set up His Kingdom on Earth for 1,000 years. i hope this helps. Daniel also shows Jesus approaching God.

Yes he has. All of them have. Do you know what the vicar of Christ means? That title cannot be any more blasphemous. They give themselves prerogatives that only belong to God. Claiming things like salvation is only through the RCC. Salvation is only through God not a man made pagan institution. They claim they can forgive you of your sins. Again, only God can do that. They demand they be called ""Holy Father"" a title that ONLY belongs to God the Father. He sits between 2 cherubim in his man made temple, while God sits in a heavenly temple with 2 cherubim. The Bible gives you over 20 descriptions of the antichrist. The pope fits every single one and its not even close. And its impossible for it to be anybody else. The Bible asserts the antichrist gets revealed after the Fall of Rome and will be here until the end of time when Christ comes back. Will be greater than all the kingdoms before it (Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome) and will be Christian. There is no entity that is here today that fits that criteria.

I’m assuming this is the reference. Many people see Revelation as circular rather than linear. Nero, or a different emperor depending on when you date the letter, was an antichrist. Same with any ruler or false teacher who sets themselves up having supreme authority. This is the example I use with people: Hitler set himself up as the supreme authority of Nazi Germany. Many churches and “Christian’s” gave their allegiance to him. If you see the mark of the beast as symbolic of giving your allegiance to empires and people instead of Jesus, then you can see how indeed Hitler was an antichrist. 

This is playing out today in any given empire where someone is demanding Christians’ allegiance when our allegiance belongs to Jesus. 

However, it is not necessarily wrong to believe that one day there may be the ultimate antichrist. It’s just that having this as your only reading leads to people unwittingly giving away their allegiance in the hopes of “protecting the faith”"

Even if he was looking back,  was the beast ""sin"" personified?  Was the beast  death?  Because death has yet to be completely defeated as has sin. Both sin and death stand condemned but so does this world

The beast arises out of the sea at some point after Jesus died on the cross and power and authority is given to him by Satan. He will be allowed to conquer the holy ones. Even if that already happened in Rome during the 1st and 2nd century, when was that beast captured along with the false prophet?  When did God's two witnesses send  fire from Heaven, then be killed by that beast and  then rose to life after 3 days?   When did Jesus come back to earth, defeat the beast and  sit down on David's throne? (Luke 1:32)

The blood on Christ's  robe would be  His own blood, not the blood of the beast. In Revelation 19 the foolish beast is  alive and is actually all set to wage war with Christ at His second coming. Christ doesn't 'kill' anyone with the sword that comes out of His mouth until after the beast and false prophet are thrown into the lake of fire.  I personally believe He ""kills"" those who took the mark of the beast by removing their hero and then sentencing them all to torment whenever they die.

When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’ “Then He will also say to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was hungry and you gave Me no food; I was thirsty and you gave Me no drink; I was a stranger and you did not take Me in, naked and you did not clothe Me, sick and in prison and you did not visit Me.’ “Then they also will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to You?’ Then He will answer them, saying, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to Me.’ And these will go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”"

However, God’s gift of eternal life comes with great responsibility.  And *where* believers spend their eternal life is completely dependent on our works *after* we have been saved.  

Those who do the work of repentance and take up their cross daily and deny their sinful selves, and love Gods laws with all their hearts minds and strength and have through study and practice of Gods ways built up their treasures in Heaven—in the Judgement these believers will hear Jesus say, “Well done my good and faithful servant and will be welcomed into God’s Kingdom”

On the other hand, those who received God’s gift of an eternal spirit and choose to abuse Gods Grace and remain in sin will be like Satan and  the angels that fell from Grace.  They knew the Truth of God and chose rebellion and they will receive the same Judgment as the fallen and burn in the lake of fire for eternity and the smoke of their torment will rise forever.

irvghv8,SeekSweepGreet,y151of,"""**Judgement**"" needs to understood in context, or, in perspective.

In court there are two phases: 'sentencing' & the 'carrying out of the sentencing'. Both are referred to as judgements in use. This can bring confusion.

Everyone will be judged in the first sense; that is, their case will be investigated, & a sentence pronounced (Rev 22:11). This happens for different people at different times, whether dead or alive. Death is a sealing, or close, of a person's record. That record (when God decides) will then be investigated.

The judgement (day) people are usually familiar with is more synonymous with the execution of a sentence; or the carrying out of a sentence (investigation). This time/event the Bible describes as the second death—the lake of fire—the fire that comes from God (Rev 20:9) & destroys all sin forevermore.

irxguqn,OrisMindTheater,y151of,I don’t believe in the rapture. It’s nowhere in the Bible. I believe In Jesus’s second coming and I believe that is when we all instantly dead and living are turned into spiritual bodies and are going to be judged. God does not come back somewhere in the middle and take a group of people who believe they don’t have to die to see Gods face because they think they aren’t sinners. The antichrist comes before Jesus’s return though and it says that one will be taken and the other left. Because those who are left are still waiting for the one true messiah lord of lords and king of kings JESUS CHRIST. Those who are dead now are only sleeping awaiting for Christs return like the rest of us. Maybe the rapture theory was made up by false teachers so you’d think that when these people are taken and you are left you loose faith in God and think you missed his return. Do not be fooled. He only comes back one more time. We all face judgment and there will be no excuse for what sins we committed but their was always time to repent and be honest and be a better person. All you can do is do your best.

irvurjo,Jayhawk_rock586,y151of,"Rapture. Are You saying there is no rapture? Or does scripture say this?

The original Greek is: harpazo - to snatch or takeaway.
Latin origins: rapturo or raptura - to be caught up

Read 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18. In this passage Paul writes about what will happen at the Second Coming of Jesus. 

“But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope. For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep. For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep. For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord. Therefore encourage one another with these words.”
‭‭1 Thessalonians‬ ‭4:13-18‬ ‭ESV‬‬

The scripture is clear. I encourage you to read 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 and 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 for an understanding of what will happen when Jesus returns to Earth. 
Also read: Matthew 24:36, Mark 13:32 and Luke 21:34-36 for 3 separate accounts of the same conversation where Jesus is talking about His Second Coming.

is2k997,Holy-Beloved,y151of,"God judges impartially. 
God judges His people.

We are saved from Wrath, and condemnation.

Not judgement. Paul says “We must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ”

We are judged based on what we accomplished through the Holy Spirit, what fruit the Spirit was able to bear in our lives, not in our own works or faithfulness, so that no one may boast.


The scripture lays this out plainly both old and new Testament, in so many places I’m not sure they all could be gathered for reference.

Jesus often says, to the one who was faithful with what was given to him, even more will be given. To him who was unfaithful, even what he has (not his salvation, but his inheritance) will be taken away. 

All unrepentant sin and lack of mercy toward others will count against us. As well as our standard of judgement towards other. And our benefit is solely derived from what we allowed God to do with our lives. I.e submitting to Him and responding to the voice of the Spirit in our hearts. 

I’m sorry if it upsets you, but if you live a completely unfaithful life for Christ, you may get to Heaven and have NOTHING. Nothing but the skin of your teeth so to speak. “Smelling like smoke” as some preachers put it.

I’m confused, allow me to defend God a bit here.

Is God unjust to reward His servants who love Him? Or is He unjust to take away from those who hated Him in this life, yet were saved nonetheless.

God equates love with obedience to His word. If we say we love God but do not walk in the Truth. We live a lie. 

All through the bible, plain and clear, SOME PEOPLE GET STUFF OTHER PEOPLE DO NOT GET. 

Does that mean God “loves” one person more than another? 

Daniel was the beloved Prophet? John was the beloved Disciple? 

Yes God has unwavering love for all people. 

Yes God judges IMPARTIALLY REGARDLESS OF WHO YOU ARE. Or else He would be unjust. 

If there are rewards based on your faithfulness and punishment based on your lack of faithfulness, which Jesus and Paul lay out very clearly, that means practically there is no way people will be rewarded equally. 

There are going to be cities, things, property, and stuff that can be “owned” and some people will be over a lot, some people won’t be over anything at all. 

That’s what the concept of the overcomer is. It’s not about losing your salvation or not. It’s about rewards.

He who perseveres will sit on my throne with me etc etc 

Let no one take your crown (no one can take your salvation, but certain crowns (there are multiple) can be forfeited

Paul says, he strives so that after all his teaching others that he himself won’t make it to heaven as a “Refuge”. That is to say, without anything, destitute 

People get extremely mad about this concept that were held accountable as to how we use our limited time on this earth.

Everything we do on this earth effects our eternal life. People hate that because they want to get out from under any responsibility toward God. “don’t we all get the same stuff?? “ etc basically making striving for God worthless. 

Does God love one person more than another because He justly rewards them according to their deeds through the Spirit? I think that’s a bad faith argument.

This brings up a separate but similar argument 

Realize that in the parable, the man who went and “Hid his talent in the ground”

Because he “Knew God to be a hard man who reaps where He did not sow, and gathers where He planted no seed”

That is a bad faith argument as well and is actually related to this discussion. The man assumed “It’s all God’s doing, and He is sovereign. If He is going to bear fruit in my life or do something through me, He will do it regardless, I can’t get in His way? Whatever He is going to use me for He will. Or He won’t.”

That’s EXACTLY THE SAME ARGUMENT the guy in the parable is having.

And the moral of the parable is no, that’s not true. God expects you to keep your heart in a usable condition, and to eliminate sin and pride from your life (take out the old leaven and be a new lump, Jesus said) so that you will be able to hear His voice.

We have a responsibility over our own hearts, so that we will hear the Master when He speaks, but also so we will respond. 

“Well God already knew how disobedient I would be” 

So? Is that a good argument? 

There are things God will do that He wouldn’t have done if you hadn’t of been faithful. God incorporate us in what He is doing. If you bury your talent in the ground, God will give your inheritance and rewards to someone else.

If you live an unfaithful, unrepentant life with Jesus, you will make it to Heaven but have lost what was stored in Heaven for you.

You will never lose God’s love, or your sonship, or your name from the Book of Life.

But your rewards are absolutely forfeitable That’s the whole point. 

“Store up for yourselves treasure in Heaven, for where your treasure is, your heart will be also.”

If you’re mad at God about this, go talk to Him about it."

I am asking for an example of a prophecy that was prophesied and fulfilled AND was then later fulfilled again at a future time. In other words, a prophecy that applies to two different times in the future equally. 

The examples provided don’t fit that definition. 

I am skeptical of the view that a prophecy should be applied to two different events. Especially if it is not necessary to do so."
iryd56w,kimikopossible,y151of,"Read Romans and reform your theology. You have the core gospel upside down.

At the very core of Christianity is the truth of the gospel. We understand certain doctrinal truths to be essential for conversion, reconciliation to God, and deliverance from God’s justice. They summarize what we must believe in order to be a Christian. The gospel is the good news that, though we have all rebelled against the God who created us, (Romans 5:12) God planned a way to show mercy when we deserved judgment. (Romans 5:8) The Father sent His Son Jesus, who went willingly, (Matthew 26:39) who Himself shared God’s very nature, into our world. (Philippians 2:6-7, John 1:1) Jesus was born of a virgin, (Luke 1:26-31) taking on human flesh in order to share our nature. (Hebrews 2:17-18) Jesus Christ, lived the life of obedience that the Father demanded of us but that we could not live (Romans 5:19), and He died the death that the Father required of us as sinners, (Hebrews 9:22) though He Himself was without sin. (2 Corinthians 5:21) Jesus’ death satisfied God’s justice (Romans 3:25) for all those who turn in faith from idolatrous rebellion to worship Him alone. (2 Corinthians 5:15)

Being freely and completely justified by one's own single act of faith, (Luke 18:13-14; Acts 10:44-48) by the righteousness of Christ (1 Corinthians 1:30), alien to our own (Philippians 3:9), His people, being wholly part of the invisible Bride which He bought by His own blood (1 Corinthians 6:20), are completely and fully united to Him by His death (Romans 6:5), and will never fall away by the power of the Spirit who is the seal and guarantee of our future complete redemption (2 Corinthians 1:22).

His resurrection declares the Father’s acceptance of his sacrifice and our hope of resurrection as well. (1 Corinthians 15:17) God’s grace offers eternal life in his presence to all who receive this work of Jesus Christ by confessing Him as Lord. (Romans 10:9-10)

This is the one gospel; (Galatians 1:7) this is Christianity."

iretfcj,moonunit170,xy01k2,"Paul is discussing the typical human internal conflict between free will and God's will. At the beginning of this chapter he points out that without God's law we are all ""free"", in other words, nothing is defined as wrong  ( which by the way is what the secularists are trying to get us back to right now by rejecting all religion and all influence of Christianity).

 But Paul was saying that until God gave the law in a code, that is to say through Moses, man was in his own mind free from sin.  But once the code came we were bound by sin - we were not free anymore to do what we wanted. And he further on narrows that discussion down to himself for he says he loves God and he wants to do what God wants him to do but he still sins.  This is the conflict between our Free Will and our human nature, which Jesus says is what we must overcome.  We must use our free will to command our bodies to obey God's will for us.

This directly conflicts with the modern epicurean idea that we are free to do whatever we want without consequence; that satisfying our own desires and pleasures ""as long as we don't hurt other people"" is acceptable to God."
irerdko,Iyare1982,xy01k2,"Read this in conjunction with Romans 5:14 to the end. It ties in very well with this. This very discusses how all of us humans struggle with Sin. I referenced the other chapter and its verses because it discusses how because of the Sin of Adam, all of us became sinners. And that because of Jesus, we now have access to grace and eternal life. Romans 7:14-25 discusses our Adamic nature. Our nature is intrinsically sinful. Do you notice with toddlers and little children, they automatically know how to be naughty? No one teaches them this. Instead we have to teach them to good. “Little Johnny, be nice and share your snacks”. That is our sinful nature. We all come out of the womb drenched in sin. It is human nature. We read God’s word, we believe it. We know it to be true and right but still we sin. We dont have an issue with the law or the commandments. We believe it is a sin to lie but we can’t help ourselves. I will give you an example. I was going into Bible study on Wednesday and my Pastor on the way in saw me and asked me how work was doing and I immediately responded with Exhausting. That was a lie. Work isnt even stressing me out right now and I was wondering why I said that. It just flew out of my mouth and it confused me because I couldnt understand why the lie came out of my mouth so quickly, easily and without thought lol. We know what is a sin because as we read the bible, God tells us and we hate that we cant help but sin. In verse 17, Paul is saying it is not what we actually want to do, it is this sinful nature that lives in our skin that causes us to keep sinning. We want to be perfect but we cant be because only Jesus was perfect. I love Gods word with all my heart but I still get tripped up into sin. The only salvation we have because of our sin is Jesus (v25). Until we get raptured and shed this skin/Adamic sinful nature for our transformed body that will be free from sin, sin will continue to be an issue for us. DOES THIS MEAN THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO INEVITABLY SIN, WE MIGHT AS WELL FORGET ABOUT THIS CHRIST THING AND KEEP SINNING? No. When you receive Jesus as you Lord and Savior, he gives you the MOST AWESOME gift, which is the Holy Spirit to be your helper. When you sin, the Holy Spirit will convict you. Sin will bother you. You will hate it and you will begin to immediately repent. If you sin and it bothers you and in your Spirit, youre cautioned to repent then the Holy Spirit is alive and well within you. Immediately repent, even if it is within your Spirit. Jesus died so that we might have GRACE. When I sin and I am convicted in my spirit, I immediately repent. I try to avoid knowingly doing something that I know to be a sin. We cant help but to sin but we can try to avoid it and repent if we do it. God is faithful and just to forgive us and through grace, we are made right with God. So to sum it up, this verse is saying that we do bad because we cant help ourselves and even when we want to do right, we sin. That is our sinful nature. That is why not one of us is intrinsically good. The human heart is very wicked and capable of thinking up the worst sorts of evil. But by Jesus, we are made right with God. Hope this helps."

He's referring to the struggle between the 2 when without the complete forgiveness brought about Jesus' death and the indwelling holy spirit. The struggle is intense.

Example will be in case we saw someone drop money and they didn’t notice our flesh want to take the money and not tell them but our spirit goese and tell them and the person says thank you and that all but then the flesh tells you why you did it you need that money 

It tells us to be aware about the bad we do and to do the good

irh4k6p,snoweric,xy01k2,"Paul is simply describing his spiritual struggles between his evil human nature and his desire to obey God's law.  

A Christian can gain a sense of competence, security, and innocence in his relationship with God, but unless they come by the power of God, they're either a distraction or a delusion that denies lasting happiness.  So man's existential dilemma shows mankind has every good reason to feel weak, guilty, and worthless apart from God, but strong, innocent, and valuable when reconciled to Him.  Paul explained the despair of the first state but the joy of the second:  ""Wretched man that I am!  Who will set me free from the body of this death?  Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!  So then, on the one hand I myself with my mind am serving the law of God, but on the other, with my flesh the law of sin"" (Rom. 7:24-25).  Christians should admit to should admit to having a guilty past but they also should have a sense of joy in salvation  (Rom. 14:17; 15:13)."
irgeg4h,hangtime94,xy01k2,What if the thing you want to do is nothing and the sin agrees. But the sin was good things.

Aka getting fat or you know any a-bomb out there. How could you be at fault? Because to agree with unclean spirits sometimes it's because the spirit has something to offer.

If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty. But even if he doesn’t, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.”
— ‭‭Daniel‬ ‭3:16-18 NLT

Simply put, we serve God before we serve men, it is the first commandment that states that we worship God and only Him as he is our only God, we must not fear men that can destroy our body but instead have fearful reverence in the Lord who we know can put us to death physically and spiritually.

Like a contract you sign agreeing to do something. Once you’ve completed your task, the contract is done, no need to go back to it but for reference maybe. Now, what is a sin? Is a sin to one person a sin across the board? I don’t believe so. I believe, if the act takes you away from God, that’s a sin. If you can worship God in your acts, how can they be a sin?

It is important to realize that it was the Church that determined what was the Bible, and not the other way around. This is something that Protestant folks have a hard time accepting, but history is clear in that regard. The canon was set over centuries.

There are disagreements within Christianity, but the core tenets are the same across all who confess the creeds. We do have more in common than we disagree. I frequently read and study with a Catholic study Bible and have no qualms in doing so. Catholics have a deep understanding of scripture and I respect their scholarly approach.

A sermon heard in a Catholic parish could easily be preached in a Lutheran one. The paradox of the faith is one that I would think be understood by all Christians.

The internet can be a poor representation of Christianity and Christians. If all I knew of Catholicism was the subreddit bearing its name, I’d be leery. But I know better because I have friends who are Catholic, Orthodox (particularly Greek & Romanian & some Russian), fellow Episcopalians, Lutherans, Baptists, and a good chunk of None of the Aboves.

I couldn’t imagine doing Christianity on my own. The church offers a wealth of resources and fellow minded Christians who are, I hope, all trying to figure out how to live the faith.

Ultimately, I don’t care which tradition one feels led to join and be a part of. I have a Big Church view on things. As long as the congregation you’re joining isn’t culty or domineering/controlling, then you’re better off in one than outside of one.

Stop right there. Go read the gospels. Jesus can only do what He saw the Father do and Jesus freed people from bondage. God is the one freeing you from bondage, not the other way around. 

Here's Luke 4 where Jesus quotes Isaiah 61

16 So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. 17 And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written:  
**18 “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,**  
**Because He has anointed Me**  
**To preach the gospel to the poor;**  
**He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted,**  
**To proclaim liberty to the captives**  
**And recovery of sight to the blind,**  
**To set at liberty those who are oppressed;**  
**19 To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”**  
20 Then He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fixed on Him. 21 And He began to say to them, “Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.” 22 So all bore witness to Him, and marveled at the gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth. And they said, “Is this not Joseph’s son?”"

“I have the right to do anything,” you say—but not everything is beneficial. “I have the right to do anything""—but not everything is constructive."
irhkcd8,andynicole93,xw6r43,"Hi, I saw your post the other night and wanted to reply but wasn't able at the time. 

It's wonderful and beautiful that you care so much about doing right and pleasing God. But the way you are speaking sounds like you feel like you're in bondage. I used to worry about those things a lot too. I would feel things like ""since this doesn't really matter for eternity, should I be doing it?"" And I was very hard on myself. 

But I think the most important thing you mentioned that needs to be talked about, is that you feel like God will send you to hell if you do these things. Do you think that if you commit a sin, God will send you to hell? That is true if you haven't received Jesus. Before Jesus. But if you are truly saved, and trusting in Jesus for salvation and forgiveness, then you WILL NOT be sent to hell. I'm not saying this to make you feel secure when I don't know your heart. It's important that you make sure you are saved, that is the important thing. If you are, then you are NOT under God's wrath and Jesus' blood covers all your sins, past and future. You never need to fear His wrath. You are His beloved child. For the believer there should never be the thought ""I sinned, I'm going to go to hell."" Because you know that Jesus paid for that sin on the cross and if you ask forgiveness it is yours. That is His free gift of grace. 

But about whether or not doing anything you enjoy is a sin, like playing video games or collecting figures. I don't think those things are sinful, unless they are causing you to sin. Some examples of how they could cause you to sin  are things like, if the games or figures are causing you to lust. Then that game would be one you shouldn't play, or you shouldn't buy that figure, because it would cause you to sin. Or if they are becoming an idol to you. If you love them more than God, then that's a sin. That's a very easy sin to fall into. So maybe we might need to limit the amount of time we spend on those things and make sure they never take away from our time with the Lord.  I love video games also. For me, one of my favorite things though is to watch TV shows. I love watching k-dramas especially. But I'm married, and I struggle a lot with being attracted to the guys in them. So there are some things I have had to give up, some shows that I stop watching or avoid watching because I know God would want me to not put myself in temptation. There will be some things that God will ask us to give up, but it is always FAR more rewarding. :)

But that doesn't mean that God wants us to never do anything we enjoy! Every good thing is a gift from God. there's a verse that says something like that. It's not a sin to enjoy things that aren't sinful. When God says ""don't love the world, or the things of the world, for whoever loves the world does not have the love of the Father in him."" I think it means something like, don't love sin. Don't love this world system of sin. You wouldn't think there was anything bad about playing a board game with your family, would you? That is just something you can enjoy and thank God for, same as video games. God is a God of joy. But He wants you to take delight in Him most of all. He also wants us to serve Him. So, I can't tell you how much video games is okay for you. I know i am still learning and I might even spend too much time on those things. I want to be less self centered and more people centered, a lover of God rather than of pleasure. But that doesn't mean I can't ever have pleasure. When I'm blessed with things that give me pleasure, I want to learn to thank God more for them. To bring Him into everything and thank Him for every blessing. I feel like I'm not very good at that but I think that is the goal. 

My advice is to make sure you are spending time with God every day and that your hobbies aren't taking away from that, and to talk to Him about these things. Ask Him to help you trust in His forgiveness for when you do sin, and ask Him to show you how which things He might want you to give up, and for the things that are okay, if you're spending too much time on them or not. Ask Him to help you love and delight in Him most. Ask Him for discernment between truth and lies of the enemy.

I hope this is helpful. I know I wrote a lot 😂 if you want to talk or have more questions feel free to message me. God bless you!!"
ir55hxf,Truthspeaks111,xw6r43,">I'm kinda beginner in being a real Christian but I feel like God placed me in a bondage and wants to take away my freedom. I try to please God and I try to always put him first when I wake up in the morning or when I sleep at night but I believe God wants me to live like a hermit in order to not be able to sin and this makes me really depressed.

Hebrews 10:36 For ye have need of patience, that, **after ye have done the Will of God, ye might receive the promise.**  
10:37 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and will not tarry.

There is a pre-salvation state and a post salvation state.  Before he that shall come comes, our spiritual state is supposed to be low as we are putting away sin and evil from our midst which is what was keeping us feeling alive.  After he that shall comes will come, our spiritual state will be raised up because the source of Eternal Life dwells in us. 

Luke 2:34 And Simeon blessed them, and said unto Mary his mother, **Behold, this \[child\] is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel**; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;"
ir5b4fr,toonguy762,xw6r43,The problem is the Bible is very clear that the wages of sin is death so in order to honor everything God says I need to be like a hermit kinda like the apostles were and this makes me unhappy. If I play a game or use anything that is in the world it it would make me part of this world which is bad in God s eyes..
irhmii5,andynicole93,xw6r43,"Also I feel like I replied without really reading your post carefully, I was kinda just remembering what I thought you said from before, so I'm sorry if I answered weirdly or didn't talk about the right things. I just read your post again and the one thing I wanted to say after reading it again is that we can never go to heaven by keeping all the 10 commandments. None of us can ever be perfect. That's why Jesus died for us, to pay the price for our sins and purchase our freedom. To give us God's gift of grace, and that is how we are saved, by trusting in His righteousness, not by keeping the commandments. The commandments are there to show us how much we need a savior. 

And having an idol isn't loving something, it's loving it more than God and letting it take God's place in your life. In other words, like I said God should be our number one joy and delight. If you spend time with Him and get to know Him and His grace and love for you, you'll see how much better He is than everything else :) he is the reason for living."
iropi59,toonguy762,xw6r43,"Thank you so much for having patience to read and reply to my question.. 

I'm a newbie born -again Christian and ex idolater. 

I'm trying to please God because  I won't lie , the way Christianity portrays Hell scares me I don't know if its an actual acurate description because Jewish people have a different opinion on Hell. I don't think I know the love of God yet. I'm struggling with demonic persecution at its finest. I've started to read the Bible to try to ""show God love and respect for the good things he done in my life but since then I struggle with a lot of mental persecution and depression...Demons send me even pysical messages to ""give up"" or send me idol statues.(believe it or not) I don't know if what I feel inside my soul is a good change or a bad change, I feel that nothing offends me, I feel so calm I can even feel spirits or demons but I don't know if this is a hardened heart or its just as a Christian should be, I feel my heart is unofendable, when someone asks for my help I do it gladly and it makes me feel good but at the same time its kinda weird I feel emotionless, is that how a Christian should feel? one of the demons who was tormenting me even admitted 'I have a lot of power"" but I don't know what is he talking about honestly. Sometimes I was helped by Jesus and to comfirm this He revealed this to me in certain dreams. 

I want to think I received Jesus because I believe he is God and that he is thr only one who can save me but I'm not sure if its the same in my subconcious and I don't know how to control that part of me. I had a dream that I was covered in Blood by two men that I felt was Jesus. Sometimes I had dreams about the future that become true, for example I seen "" a war happening that I seen is this war between russia and ukraine. I saw 1-2 years ago , I think God wanted to show me this and he took me in outer space and I could see black smoke coming out from a part of our plannet where is actually situated russia and ukraine. I also try to confess every sin I make daily. 

The weird part about this sin ""Lust"" is that you or many people don't know that its actually a real being its actually a demon. Out of curiosity, how do you know you are sinning through lust? Do you feel somehow inside of you this presence?  I even met this demon on thr internet and he introduced himself to me and I tested some things, when he is in my house I feel his presence 'I feel lust"" when he leaves I feel liberated from this ""sin""  It's very strange because before talking to him I didn't even know this ""feeling""(sin) was bad in God s eyes, I thought this feeling was normal but the weird part is that this demon recommended me I should check the internet for prayers against lust and even made me read the Bible, so out of fear of him and God I really started to read the Bible but my experience confuses me.I always thought they hated the Bible. I'm not sure if the end of the world is going to happen but this demon is trying also tp repent for some of its sins.
Yes I did test when I play a cool graphic game daily I start to feel lust again. But If I take it more slowly I'm fine.Sometimes Its really hard to tell from excitement to lust-_-"".. I agree that God is saying to not love the world but I think the translations are a bit ambiguous because in another place the Bible says ""For God so loved the world , yet we are not allowed to love the world I guess its reffering to sinful things as you said above. I am super greatful for what God created he is very cool, my only regret is that he doesn't talk to us like you talk to me because I really wished I could thank him for the great things he created. I find it difficult to be able to fully thank him for what he is doing, back in the past I used to create 3D images to thank him and I used to create characters with his name in video games to show him my love and gratitude but I give it up because I'm afraid of idolatry or to take his name in vain...I used to name my video game characters so I woulf make him known to other people but I'm not sure if he approves or not so I gave it up. 

I read on the internet that God wants us to put him first ""no other gods before me"" So thr first thing I do when I wake up in the morning is read the Bible and only after I do something else and also when I go to sleep at night I read the Bible, does this mean the rest of the day when I do other stuff or play video games they are taking me away from God?"
ir5bo9l,crowned_glory_1966,xw6r43,"You are correct. Do you believe that Christ died for your sins? Do you really know Jesus? If you do, then …

“So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.”

irhmoce,andynicole93,xw6r43,I also recommend reading Psalm 16 :)
irzhwr6,andynicole93,xw6r43,"I'm happy to talk to you about these things and I hope it helps some. :) 


You are saying that you don't think you know the love of God, and also that you are reading the Bible to try to show God your love, and trying to please Him because you are afraid of hell. To become a born again Christian means to believe that Jesus, God's son, died for you, He took all the punishment for your sins, and to trust in Him, as your Savior and Lord. That means trusting that He really did pay for your sins and you are forgiven. Do you trust Him? If so, you don't have to be afraid of hell anymore. You don't have to please Him so that you won't go to hell. It's a free gift, all you have to do is accept it. That is His love. If you want to know His love more, think more about what Jesus did for you. 1 John 3:16 says:  ""This is how we have come to know love: He laid down his life for us."" Doing things like reading the Bible won't make you any more acceptable to Him. Jesus already did that for you. But reading the Bible will help you know Him more, and His love for you, and help you grow in that trust. 

I think that the reason Jewish people don't have the same description of hell, is that Judaism doesn't believe that Jesus was the Messiah or the son of God, so they don't believe any of the new testament to be scripture, but most of the teachings on hell are in the new testament. In the Old Testament, people didn't have much knowledge about what happened after death. But all of the Bible is 100% trustworthy, because it was inspired by God. You can trust what it says about hell, but you can also trust what it says about Jesus and salvation. :) 

I'm sorry you have been experiencing demonic oppression. I'm also sorry to hear you have been struggling with depression since you started to read the Bible. I believe that demons are real, it says so in the Bible. I am also sure that the devil does not want you to grow closer to the Lord and doesn't want you reading the Bible, so it makes sense that things got harder in your life after you started reading. But if you continue to read, you will find encouragement and help. I want to share with you some of the verses in the Bible about demons. 

""That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick."" Matthew 8:16 

""The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name.” He said to them, “I watched Satan fall from heaven like lightning. Look, I have given you the authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy; nothing at all will harm you. However, don’t rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”  Luke 10:17‭-‬20 

So although demons are real, they cannot harm you. Jesus has all power over every demon. He cast them out of many people, with just one word. His disciples cast them out with just His name. You don't have to be afraid of them. I would encourage you, please don't listen to anything demons say to you. ""Therefore, submit to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.""

James 4:7   That is the truth. Next time you feel demonic oppression, tell it to leave in Jesus' name. Only listen to God. He does talk to us, I know that sometimes we wish we could hear His voice audibly like we can another human, but He wants us to have faith. The Bible is His word to us. Reading it is how we hear from Him. He speaks to His people personally through the Holy Spirit while reading the Bible. Ask Him to help you hear His voice. Also, you said that you wish you could thank Him. You definitely can! He hears when you pray. You can just tell Him how thankful you are for the things He made, and He will hear you. :) 

About feeling like you are unoffendable, like you are emotionless when doing good, and whether that is normal for a Christian. I have also worried whether I felt the way I should lots. I think I might know what you are experiencing. It sounds like you are very introspective like me, like you think a lot about what you are feeling and thinking. When I was a new Christian I worried a lot about whether I was genuine. I still do sometimes  I think that is healthy to a degree. Because a lot of people just assume they are saved when they aren't, so it is very good to try to make sure. But I have also been learning how unreliable our emotions are. Our emotions are affected by so many things, like our hormones, how much sleep we got, what kind of food we are eating, all kinds of things. If our hormones are out of balance it can mess with our emotions like crazy. So we might have a very joyful experience when spending time with God one day, and another day not feel much of anything. That doesn't mean that God is any less there that day. He is the same as always. So that's why we should rely on what is true, (what the Bible says) instead of our emotions. 

This year I'm reading the Charles Spurgeon devotional Morning and Evening, and here's something about that that left a huge impact on me and helped me so much. The whole thing is so so good so I'll share the link here: https://www.truthforlife.org/devotionals/spurgeon/6/28/2021/ Its about looking to Jesus instead of ourselves and our own emotions."
irzi0z7,andynicole93,xw6r43,"I don't really know what you experienced with the demon you think is called Lust. I believe that lust is a sin, because in the Old Testament God says that committing adultery is a sin, and in the new testament Jesus showed that not only is commiting the act a sin, but He said that if you lust after a woman, you have committed adultery with her already in your heart. That applies to a woman lusting after a man also. So because I'm a married woman, that's how I know that it is sinful for me to desire men other than my husband. Because Jesus said so, it's cheating on my husband in my heart. So whenever I have those feelings, although it isn't a sin to be tempted, it would be a sin for me to indulge them and think about that other man. That's why I avoid temptations as much as I can. 

I don't really think that a demon could repent, so I'm not sure what it was that you experienced, but I'm sorry it confused you. I would encourage you to please not talk to this demon if you think it is talking to you. Like I said before, tell it to leave in Jesus' name. Resist it. It can't harm you, but demons and the devil will try to deceive you and lead you away from Jesus. 


Some verses about this: 


""No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.""  1 Corinthians 10:20‭-‬21 ESV


And these verses I feel are especially appropriate for this conversation since it also talks about how those demons sometimes try to place restrictions on believers about things that God never meant to restrict them on. It uses marriage and food as an example because that's what was going on in that time, but I think this could also apply to what we were talking about. Doing things you enjoy that aren't sinful. If it isn't a sin, God hasnt forbidden it. We can do things like play games if they aren't bad, with thankfulness to God for the good gift. This is a warning not to listen to demons: 


""Now the Spirit explicitly says that in later times some will depart from the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and the teachings of demons, through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared. They forbid marriage and demand abstinence from foods that God created to be received with gratitude by those who believe and know the truth. For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving, since it is sanctified by the word of God and by prayer."" 1 Timothy 4:1‭-‬5 CSB

I can't really tell you yes or no, whether playing video games is taking you away from God. I think probably not, I think it is good that you are reading the Bible in the morning and night. That is wonderful. I would say, as long as that video game isn't causing you to sin or leading you into temptation it is okay. Just keep focusing on getting to know God more and trusting Him. As you grow closer to Him, he will show you if He wants you to stop doing something. He is the one who will help you love Him more than those other things, we can't do that ourselves. 

Also, if you are struggling severely with depression, it's good to go to a doctor. There is nothing wrong with that. Please take care of yourself. 

One last thing, have you seen the show ""The Chosen""? It's an amazing new show about Jesus that is really well made and it's free to watch in every country. If you type the chosen in the app store you can download the app on your phone :) the first episode even deals with demon possession and it's amazing."
ir5fn7w,toonguy762,xw6r43,"Yes I believe he is God in the flesh and that he died for everyone s sins(including my own) I read the Bible but I'm not sure if I have a relationship with him or not I don't know what other people like yourself are experiecing in a relationship with him so I can compare it to my own. I only experience massive demonic harassments, so I'm assuming I'm doing things God intended me to do or rather they just harass me to believe I'm doing the right thing. But the times when the apostles lived were very different from our times. Now there are all kinds of beautiful and luxury things...😐"
ir5g2m6,crowned_glory_1966,xw6r43,Oh I totally get what you’re saying that I don’t know if what I am experiencing with God is what another person also experiences. We are so different that our experiences are going to be totally different than the next person. To really experience God you have to have a deep relationship with him. Since Friday I have been in a training at our church for what is called an Emmanuel encounter andI just have to say wow. Once we have An encounter with him it all becomes more real. If you want to know more about encountering Jesus on a very intimate level look into Carle Lehman and Margaret Webb on the Internet. They are both people that are teaching others how to have a deeper walk with Christ.

ir75jb5,Zosima93,xwl5eq,"Most scholars would say after. Adela Yarbro Collins theorized it was written during Domitian’s reign, so sometime between 81 and 96 AD, and that’s stuck around as a popular theory."
ir7ccm2,PsilocybinCEO,xwl5eq,After. The common consensus seems to be the Domitianic Date of 95-96CE. Here is a [good paper](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C48&q=book+of+revelation+dating&btnG=#d=gs_qabs&t=1665004927861&u=%23p%3DkLet4gd5rNAJ) you can read in defense of that dating.
ir7wqv5,zanillamilla,xwl5eq,"Revelation is usually regarded as finalized in the 90s CE during Domitian's enforcement of the fiscus Judaicus. But it is a composite work likely compiled over decades. I would argue that some early visionary units in Revelation date to the 60s, particularly 11:1-14 which expresses the view that the sanctuary would not be breached, reflecting the perspective in earlier Jewish tradition and by the Zealots that the Temple was inviolable (cf. Zechariah 12:2-6, 1 Enoch 56:5-8, Sibylline Oracles 5.101-10, Josephus, BJ 5.459, 6.98; cf. Dio Cassius 65.5.4), with the Gentile trampling of the city only lasting the same duration as prophesied by Daniel. So this does not look like an ex eventu prediction but one made during the events prior to Titus' destruction of the Temple in 70 CE that counters the expectation that the Gentiles will breach the sanctuary. The act of measuring in v. 1-2 has in mind Ezekiel 40-42 which mentions the wall surrounding the inner court (42:20, cf. 1 Kings 6:36, 7:12), as well as Zechariah 2:1-5 which posits Yahweh himself as a wall of fire protecting the people inside (compare also Zechariah 12:1-9).  Another early unit is ch. 17 which probably dates to the early 70s. There is a clear contemporary allusion to the emperors of Rome, with the five fallen kings possibly analogous to the Julio-Claudian dynasty (Augustus, Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius, Nero), suggesting that the king who ""is"" may have been Vespasian (with the year of four emperors being treated as an interregnum). It is technically possible that four emperors were counted in the list, which would date the unit to 69 CE.  But decisive evidence against this is the sesterius from 71 CE which depicts exactly the image of the woman (the goddess Dea Roma, lampooned as a prostitute by John of Patmos) sitting on the seven hills of Rome (17:9).  The chapter also evidences a clear notion of Nero redivivus with the last emperor being one of the five earlier emperors, as he presently ""is not"" (οὐκ ἔστιν), i.e. has already died (ὃ ἦν).  The first pretenders arose in 69 CE but the third pretender in 88 CE in Parthia nearly resulted in war (Tacitus, Historiae 1.2, Suetonius, Nero 57). 

In the analysis of David Aune, an original collection of twelve independent units of visions and auditions were later inserted into a heptadic structure (three of the twelve units were placed between the seven trumpets and the seven bowls, while another three were placed inside the seven seals structure in between the sixth and seventh seal). The heptadic material may date to the 80s CE in light of a possible allusion to the Vesuvius eruption (8:8-9) and a more developed Nero redivivus expectation that may draw on the pretender from 88 CE (so the Beast brings forth the kings of the East over the Euphrates from Parthia). The book was finalized in the 90s with the addition of the epistolary frame and other redactional touches throughout (as discussed by Aune which attempt to unify the heterogeneous material). I think it is reasonable to consider Revelation as John's life's work compiling together his many visions and auditions he experienced over several decades. It is in the epistolary material where one finds likely allusions to Domitian's enforcement of the fiscus Judaicus (which occurred between 88 and 96 CE), resulting in the banishment of Jewish Christians like John and execution of Gentile Christians (resulting in some Christians leaving the Christian community). John also makes Jesus promise them ""I will not blot out your name from the book of life (οὐ μὴ ἐξαλείψω τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ ἐκ τῆς βίβλου τῆς ζωῆς)"" (v. 5), a statement that undoes the curse in the Birkat ha-Minim ""Let them be blotted out of the book of life and not be written together with the righteous"". So I think Revelation is an early witness to the addition of the 18th benediction to the ‘Amidah. According to the Marius Heemstra (*The Fiscus Judaicus and the Parting of the Ways*; Mohr Siebeck, 2010), the birkat ha-Minim arose in this period in part as a response to Domitian's tax policy during which Christians were excluded from synagogues in many places (cf. the neologism ἀποσυνάγωγος in the gospel of John, also dating to the 90s CE, as a term for synagogue expulsion, cf. 9:22, 12:42, 16:2). This date fits well with the claim in Irenaeus, Hegesippus, and Eusebius that John was released from imprisonment at Patmos in the reign of Nerva (96-98 CE)."
ir7uka9,NerdyReligionProf,xwl5eq,"There has been a growing movement to understand Revelation as a Jewish apocalypse written in the late 60s, very shortly before the culmination of the Roman siege of Jerusalem and sacking of the temple. John Marshall's 2001 monograph, *Parables of War*, argued for this view in the most programmatic way - and I've been largely persuaded by it. To be sure, the issue of Revelation being a Jewish (not Christian) apocalypse is separable from the question of date."
ira6bfd,benbrasford,xwl5eq,"Some use St. Irenaeus' Book 5 Chapter 30 for the date due to a statement that he made:  


""We will not, however, incur the risk of pronouncing positively as to the name of Antichrist; for if it were necessary that his name should be distinctly revealed in this present time, it would have been announced by him who beheld the apocalyptic vision. For that was seen no very long time since, but almost in our day, towards the end of Domitian's reign.""

The only explanation I can think of is that church no longer existed when John wrote down the Revelation of Christ. Its a fact Christians had fled Jerusalem and the Jews were dispersed by  70AD.  John was a jew and he was Christian.   John  didn't write to any churches in Rome. He was exiled by Rome to the island of Patmos which is off the coast of modern day Turkey where all 7 churches he did address were located.

it5co47,rbibleuser,y8ghr3,"Growing up, we memorized KJV. (I'm not KJV-only, that's just what we memorized.) I have found later in life that there is a certain amount of ""stickiness"" to the Old English... there's something about the weirdness of it that makes it a lot more memorable than modern English. Today, I mostly read NIV and occasionally fall back to KJV, but I can always remember the KJV phrase-ology.

Memorizing Scripture is like memorizing anything else, there are tons of tricks out there. You can use flash-cards, mnemonics, etc. Personally, I just do it the old-fashioned way. I read through the text to understand what the verse is actually talking about (I don't do ""rote"" memorization), and then I start memorizing the verse phrase-by-phrase.

Take John 1:1 for example. The context is talking about the Word, it's talking about Jesus (who is the Word), it's talking about creation, and it's talking about incarnation. Knowing only this, the first verse basically memorizes itself:

- ""In the beginning was the Word"" (mirroring Gen. 1)
- ""and the Word was with God""
- ""and the Word was God""

Since I can easily remember the topic/context of John 1, memorizing John 1:1 is so easy it's almost impossible not to remember it.

In pretty much any context, you can pick out verses within that context that are like this. They contain the ""thesis"" of the passage (sometimes the first verse, sometimes the last, sometimes in the middle) and then use those verses as mnemonic ""anchors"".

Verses of poetry may have residual metrical form in English (there is still a certain poetic cadence and flow to the language, despite being translated) and you can use this as a mnemonic. Hymns, choruses, praise songs can also help.

To build momentum, start by memorizing a small passage perfectly. This will help you encourage yourself. So, memorize the whole of Psalm 23 (very short) or The Lord's Prayer, word-for-word. Memorize John 3:16 word-for-word. And so on. These ""small victories"" will help push you along as you begin tackling longer, more difficult passages."

My understanding is that the OT in KJV relies mostly on the masoretic texts which are Hebrew manuscripts from the 9th and 10th centuries and NT relies mostly on the textus receptus produced by Erasmus in the 1500s. Erasmus was working with a few very late Byzantine manuscripts that were available to him and in some cases he had to backtranslate some of the missing verses in his Greek manuscripts from Latin manuscripts. Later scholars made some revisions to the textus receptus and didn’t change its name (eg theodore beza). KJV was created before many of the greatest manuscripts that revolutionized our knowledge of the texts were discovered. First the Dead Sea scrolls. Before their discovery in the 1940s our earliest OT text was masoretic texts. Also before codex sinaiticus (the oldest complete manuscript of the entire NT) as well as dozens of manuscripts from Egypt. Because of this I seem to think modern translations are closer to the original wording. 

That’s not to say there aren’t also valid reasons to think that sinaiticus and Vaticanus may have been influenced by gnostics. Does that outweigh the potential changes and copying errors that could have occurred until the 16th century? It’s tricky.

I’ll say this, theologically speaking there aren’t enormous differences at a high level either way. The majority texts and textus receptus (primary source for the NT in KJV) are in about 99% agreement. The critical editions and majority texts are about 98% agreement. So in that sense an argument can be made for saying they were preserved but if we are being very technical, no we don’t have any autographs so it’s impossible to know with total certainty that the word was maintained. If you don’t have the autographs then regardless of attempts to reconstruct the autographs we can only do so as a best guess given the available evidence. That requires faith or inference to fill in the gap of absolute proof. This will always need to be taken into account.

it0ey3o,The_Way358,y8ghr3,"I find the King James Bible to be an accurate transmission of God's Word. The best, in fact. 

A common complaint about the KJV is that it has “thee and thou,” making it sound old. Even though these words don’t harm the understanding of the text, people want them removed. However, translators chose to use them, for good reason. 

In modern English, *you* can refer to one person or to a group of people. King James English distinguishes between the singular (*thou, thee*) and the plural (*ye, you*). An example of why this is so important is when one tries to read John 3 in modern versions, versus the King James. In modern versions, Jesus is recorded as saying, ""*You* must be born again."" But, how can a person discern whether Jesus is speaking specifically to Nicodemus and him alone, or to everyone in general, if we remove the word ""ye"" from our Bibles altogether? 

Just to be clear, I'm not ""KJV Only,"" as much as I'm ""*Masoretic/Byzantine Text* Only."" I find the label ""KJVO"" to be a misnomer, and a rather deliberate and deceptive one at that, being that it was created by the opposition to mislead the masses into believing that folks like myself seriously believe that the English language has a monopoly on the true Word of God or that no could even understand or possess the Scriptures prior to 1611, when what my position ACTUALLY believes is that the KJV is simply a good translation of **good manuscripts**. 

It is wholly possible for something to be a good translation of **bad manuscripts**. So, ultimately, it's not really about what should be considered a good or bad translation. ***It's about what it is that's being translated in the first place.*** 

Here's the reasoning behind my statements: 

The KJV's New Testament is based off of a Greek text compiled by Erasmus in the 16th century. The manuscripts used to compile this text mostly reflected Byzantine (Majority Text) readings. The text he produced (later known as the Textus Receptus—""Received Text"") was an eclectic text (one which selects elements from a variety of sources). 

Different scholars have different philosophies (or theories) as to how to ascertain the original reading of a passage whenever encountering a discrepancy among manuscripts. There are two main theories for determining which readings hold more weight. The first theory (which stands behind the Byzantine Text) is that the reading of the majority of manuscripts will usually indicate which reading is correct. The second theory (which stands behind most all other English translations) believes that the earlier the copy of the text, the more likely the reading is to be true. There are good reasons, both logical and theological, to hold to the former theory while rejecting the latter. One good reason is demonstrated by the fact that the decision to choose a reading for older (yet far fewer) manuscripts whenever they disagree is ultimately subjective, whereas using more numerous manuscripts (attested by a greater amount of witnesses) does not allow for this to even be a problem in the first place. 

It also must be pointed out that before the invention of printing, the Scriptures were transmitted by hand copying and circulation. The generally acknowledged and accepted manuscripts were, of course, widely used and so wore out fairly quickly and had to be continuously recopied on fresh papers or parchments. Great numbers were always current, however, and there was thus a continual self-checking process going on, securing the text against any significant accumulation of copyists’ errors. It was from this source that the Greek New Testament known as the Textus Receptus was compiled. The great majority of the surviving manuscripts agree with this so-called “Byzantine” text, as preserved through the early centuries of Christianity by the Greek-speaking churches themselves. 

When a manuscript was prepared, which either through carelessness or deliberate intent, contained significant errors or alterations, it naturally would tend to be discarded when its character was discovered. Unless it was deliberately discarded, however, it would tend to survive longer than others, for the very reason that it was not being used. This is probably the case with the *Sinaitic and Vatican* manuscripts, also known as Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus/Codices B and Aleph, which were discovered in the 19th Century and which were older than any of the still-preserved manuscripts of the Received Text. It was *assumed* that because the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus manuscripts were older than the manuscripts of the Byzantine text, they are therefore better and more accurate. This is not so. Though the manuscripts were older and appeared in better shape, it was because they were not used because of the many errors found in them. 

Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus are both of dubious origin. Scholars have designated these manuscripts as Alexandrian, linking them with Alexandria, Egypt, the region responsible for early heresies such as Gnosticism. Every time Alexandria is ever even mentioned in the New Testament, it never has anything good to say about it (Acts 6:9; 18:24-26; 27:26; 28:11). In contrast, the Byzantine Text (which the Textus Receptus is largely based on) can be traced all the way back to Antioch, where ""the disciples"" were first called Christians (Acts 11:16). We don't have the originals of the NT, which is why it makes more sense that if the Majority Text has all these manuscripts from all over the area where the Church first began and they all agree, then those must be based on the originals. 

Unfortunately, we have no direct English translations of the Byzantine Text, (at least, not any good ones). Instead, we only really have translations based on the *Textus Receptus*, which is still technically an eclectic text in the end. What this means is that, while most readings in the TR are indeed informed by the Byzantine, some aren't. So, the King James isn't exactly perfect. It's simply the best thing we have on hand, until a proper English translation of the Byzantine is created. Thus, we must still be careful with how certain verses are read, as they may not actually be supported by the Majority Text. 

Regardless, I'll still always reccomend the King James over and against most modern versions, as it's far more reliable and a better translation in general (in my opinion)."

it0150p,Sea_Cauliflower_1950,y8ghr3,"I would be weary of the NRSV because of the gender neutral inclusive language. While this may sound like a good idea, what this translation does is it hides uses of “Son of Man“ in the Old Testament. This is important because “Son of Man” is the title that Christ most often uses for himself, and it’s a call back to its usage in the old testament. If you read the NRSV, these old testament usages will be buried. There are also psalms that are prophetically about Christ, but this is harder to see the connection when “they” is used instead of the original “him.”"

On a practical note, over forty years of me paying attention, I’m yet to see a single person moved from their belief system via debate. Most often this is because people tend to dig their heels in when needing to defend their ideology. 

Given that none of us can have total certainty that our theology is the perfect standard of truth (1 Cor 13:9), I’d encourage you to approach these conversions with a high degree of humility. While the other person can argue a point of philosophy or theology, they can’t argue your own personal testimony (which I have seen result in people being persuaded to explore other views). 

I like the balance struck in Peter: 

“But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to give an answer to every man who asketh you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear.”

It is EXTREMELY simple. Jesus said to get to heaven love [everyone] as yourself. Paul said the whole of the law is love [everyone] as yourself. God the Father said to get to heaven love everyone as yourself.

ANY religion that teaches some other doctrine is an apostate church.

I do not need to study other religions to know this, just study the Bible.

See, when I was a young kid of 10 or so growing up in a fundamental Baptist church I would hear the pastor say not get to heaven worship God, yet I could plainly see where Jesus said just love everyone as yourself.

Now, if you want to find the errors of denominations then go ahead, but it is not needed. 

The fundamental baptists claim you don't have to love everyone as yourself because they take this verse in the Bible: ""Rightly dividing the word of truth"" which means to walk a straight line, steer a  straight course, stay on the path. But the fundamental baptists claim that this verse gives them the right to throw any out verses they don't like and only accept the verses they do because the ""word"" is the Bible and they are to divide it. Seriously. Look it up. They take one verse out of context and start ripping pages out of their Bible, ""Jesus wasn't talking to me, he was talking to the Jews'

The Catholic church is obviously flawed because they claim without Any scriptural proof whatsoever they the pope was given the power of Peter first off, and second that Peter has the authority of Jesus. Nothing to back it up.

All dogma is bad and the only denomination without dogma is non denominational which basically means no dogma."

That's a pretty bad attempt as it a) is the only passage that says that and b) is never used in context lol

I'll offer some other wholesome passages that are more closely related and show a repeating theme:

Jonah 4:2 - 
So he complained to the Lord about it: “Didn’t I say before I left home that you would do this, Lord? That is why I ran away to Tarshish! I knew that you are a merciful and compassionate God, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. You are eager to turn back from destroying people.

2 Peter 3:9 - 
The Lord isn’t really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent.


Ezekiel 33:11 -
""Say to them, 'As surely as I live, declares the Sovereign LORD, I take no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but rather that they turn from their ways and live. Turn! Turn from your evil ways!


However, if you want a passage that best sums it up (regardless of your feelings towards it or if you don't believe in what's implied):

John 3:16—For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.

But that hits home harder when you couple it with:


John 1:1‭-‬3‭, ‬14—In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made... The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth."
it2qv49,OdinPairish,y8glpw,"What I generally do is break down what I'm trying to memorize into acronyms in an effort to utilize a memory method known as Active Recall.  So if I was supposed to memorize the following

We believe that people working together in mutual respect towards a common goal can create a bond of confidence and a pillar of support which facilitates the process of positive individual change"" 

I would break it down as 

WOTB AOFW. (We of the brown..  accept ourselves for who) and continue this pattern down the entire passage I'm trying to memorize.  

Notice though that the acronym doesn't break down the passage word for word, this is intentional.  I believe it assists in the active recall method.  Essentially the goal is to get repetitions of what you're trying to remember while feeding your mind the least amount of information you can so it ""adheres"" to your mind for better retention

There is possibly a way to do this easier and quicker with a method called Person Action Object where you would assign a picture an action and an object to each section of what you're trying to remember but I haven't finished experimenting with that method enough to accurately outline it as a viable way to achieve your result.

You said you were gifting a Bible to a nonbeliever. You asked which important verses should you point out. That makes no sense if you are one also

An unbeliever doing this doesn't make any sense.

Furthermore, people do actually read and study religions just for the educational value and not necessarily because they believe. I am agnostic and have read the Bible more than once. I too am here in a bible subreddit because I am interested in what the Bible says and studying it, not because I am a believer.

isywepx,NathanStorm,y89sn1,"Isaiah chapter 11 was written shortly after the 722 BCE Assyrian conquest of Israel and the dispersal of the Israelite elite throughout the Assyrian empire.  
  
In chapter 11, Isaiah is expressing his hope that the Lord will bring the Israelites back to their homeland under the rule of a Davidic king. Jesse was the legendary father of the former King David and, in metaphorical terms, a new shoot will be (Isaiah hopes) the king who unites Israelite and Jew, bringing about unprecedented peace and harmony, portrayed by hyperbole in the verses that follow.  
  
War had almost broken out between Israel (which Isaiah refers to as ‘Ephraim’) and Judah prior to the Assyrian intervention, which explains verse 11:13 telling us that there will be harmony between Israelite and Judahite:

>The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

The concluding verse makes this very clear:

>Isaiah 11:16: And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people, which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt."
iszw52w,HoneyWest55,y89sn1,Yes the prophecy is concerning Jesus appearance on earth.  It also refers to a later fulfillment when Jesus takes possession of his heavenly throne and the peaceful conditions that will occur during his kingship of God's kingdom.  Of course we have not seen those peaceful conditions as yet so they are meant to occur at a future time.

The next couple of verses deal with his attributes, “The Spirit of the Lord shall rest on him” then moves to his actions as Judge. 

Then we have a short word picture of The Kingdom on Earth. 

We have a marker that the Gentiles will believe in Him. 

Someone else commented that this was given against the backdrop of the divided kingdoms of Israel and Judah, that is correct."
it01zec,Relevant-Ranger-7849,y89sn1,"isiah lived i believe right before the 10 northern tribes were taken by the assyrians. that is why the samaritans of Jesus' time were not accepted by Jews. the northern 10 tribes were intermixed at the time the assyrians took them over. so that is why the jews did not have any dealings with the samaritans. Samaria was the capital of the northern 10 tribes. a lot of the old testament prophecies are dual prophecies, meaning they happen in more than one time frame. they are called dual fulfillments. some things of what isiah has prophesied has not happened yet.  i believe isiah 11 will happen at the second coming, during the 1,000 year reign of Christ. some of it already happened with Jesus coming forth from the root of jesse. it is a root because from the southern tribes, namely Judah, a king must still reign for Israel some day. since judah or israel kingship was not fully destroyed, a stump remained. from that stump a shoot or a branch came forth. Indeed, Jesus did come from the stump of Jesse. The royal authority of the house of David was dormant for 600 years when Jesus came as King and Messiah. When Jesus came forth, it was like a new green Branch coming from an apparently dead stump. isiah 11 6-9 happen at the millinuem kingdom. isiah 11 10-12 most of which has happened with the gentiles coming to jesus, but also during the days of His reign as King, other nations will seek Him. there will be a time when Jesus has all people from the four corners of the earth at His second coming. technically Jesus' reign has not started yet. but it will begin at His second coming. right now, He sits at the right hand of God."

Or God was lying, which He cannot do."
it780ju,ArchaicChaos,y7ff52,"Yeah. Like, by your standard here, ""you can only know through divine revelation,"" this becomes an unfalsifiable argument. If I have God's holy spirit guiding me into truth and I see him work in me and around me every single day, and the truth revealed to me is so plainly and clearly that the man he sent and empowered and anointed as his son isn't ""God,"" but a man who relied on God and was glorified for his humility, then we have a conflict. I say Jesus isn't God by divine revelation and you say he is God by divine revelation. This can't ever be solved this way. 

I don't think the argument ""can't"" be solved, personally, I just think it won't be. Because people feel like they have too much to lose in this world by saying Jesus isn't God. ""My church will shun me. Oh people will say I'm a heretic. People will talk as bad about me as they do the pentecostals and JWs and the Mormons. I've already gone on record as saying Jesus is God. How do I admit I'm wrong?"" Once anyone looks into these issues, they can pretty easily see that they don't stand up to reason. You said Jesus claimed to be God only when speaking to the Pharisees. I assume you're referring to John 8:58 or 10:30. Jesus isn't claiming to be God in either case. He *cant* be if we look at the context. You say people confess him as God. I assume you mean John 20:28. Again, he isn't being referred to as God. The grammar is decidedly for *two* referents, not one. 

I think the divine revelation argument doesn't stand up because it contradicts previous revelation. For example, the revelation of the letter to the Hebrews. The covenant of Christ is greater than the old covenant, because the old law was given by angels and the new law is given by Jesus who was raised to the throne of God as a man who learned obedience through what he suffered. If Jesus is God, this argument can't be true. If Jesus is the angel of the lord, then it is he who gives the old law, and therefore, no argument can be made for why his giving of the new law is greater. If Jesus' glorification is to receive glory he already had, then the argument can't stand still. Anachronistically superimposing another person of God and a secondary divine nature to Christ in his ministry to clear up difficulties which did not exist in the first place, is a clear hermeneutic and exegetical fallacy. I do believe this is definitely an argument worth having. Though I don't think it will ever be synthesized the way it should be."

The author of the book of Revelation thought he was God? Pretty simple.

It's pretty obvious that the authors of the Synoptic Gospels thought Jesus was the SON OF GOD. Not God himself.

And Paul as well. The earliest sources do not portray Jesus as THE God."
isuh9n7,ArchaicChaos,y7ff52,"Without God, Jesus couldn't save us. Without God the Father, there is no saviour. There is no saviour besides God. This is true. It doesn't mean that Jesus isn't our saviour or that he's God. It means Jesus is how God saves us. You also can't neglect the context of the writings. Isaiah is about a message God gives Isaiah for the nation of Israel. Did Jesus come and save Israel from their sins by dying on a cross in Isaiahs time? No. So when we say that Jesus saved us on the cross, you can't anachronistically apply this to a different audience, a different context, and a different time than Isaiah. This is a hermeneutic fallacy. 

God the Father is our saviour, and without him, besides him, there is no saviour. Jesus is how God saves us. Without God, Jesus couldn't be our saviour. It's not a contradiction, nor do you need to assume Jesus is God to say he's our saviour. Jesus is our saviour, because God saves us through him."
isyvein,NathanStorm,y7ff52,">If God says in Isaiah that there is no Savior besides Him, but then Jesus is called the Savior (in NT)...

isuqaqr,ArchaicChaos,y7ff52,"Thank you for not responding to anything I said but just repeating yourself. It wasn't a good argument of association the first time you used it, not sure why you thought using it a second time would magically make it a good argument.

Isaiah 44:24 says that God made everything by himself. With no one else. God is one self. One person. With no other persons did *he* create anything. So when *he* says ""there is no saviour besides *me*"" do you imagine this person speaking is the Father, or Jesus? If you wish to say it's the Father, and Jesus is another person of the Trinity, then you run into the problem you're trying to force on everyone else. You have 2 persons who claim to be saviours, even though in this verse, one person claims he is the saviour. If you wish to say this one person is Jesus, then not only are you saying the Father is *not* our saviour, but also that Jesus is the Father of Israel in this passage. This can't be correct.

You're trying to make a bad argument that a lot of people make. You act as if God is the Trinity, and the one saviour is ""anything and anyone that is God."" So you have one saviour, God, and so two saviours, the Father and Jesus. But this passage doesn't say that anything that's God is the saviour and there's only one God. A person is speaking, and he, alone, says that there is no saviour besides *me.* not ""us."" You don't have multiple persons of the Trinity claiming to be the one saviour. This argument you're trying to spin into forcing Jesus into a puzzle piece in which he doesn't fit not only commits adultery to the text, it doesn't help your point at all. You're looking at massive errors in your reasoning and deciding to be blind to it so you can pat yourself on the back. See if that holds up on judgement day."

There are no such implications in the Synoptics. Why is that?

In both links, there's option to get plenty more info if you want it. 

>Do the NT scriptures contradict the OT or is Jesus really the one and only true God?

Bifurcation fallacy. Neither of these options are true, and it's a logical fallacy to say these are the only options.

>For Jews and for Christians there cannot be two true Gods.

This is a misrepresentation fallacy, as no one argued otherwise. If anything, it's you who argues otherwise. It's obvious that no Jew believed in a ""tripersonal God."" Or some triple godhead. Ridiculous. 


Since people are lazy and don't tend to read anything more than the bare minimum, I expect that you won't read the links. Though, you should, if you genuinely want an answer. It should also be noted that you, too, didn't answer my objections and just hope that you can bring a red herring fallacy across the way to deflect the issue. If your view is so correct, why are you guys so miserably failing to respond to the objections?

So the short answers of John 1:3 are:

1. ""All things"" refer to all things ""in the beginning,"" and the beginning is not Genesis creation but the new creation, as is made evident from 1 John 1. See the links if you want this broken down for you.

2. The text doesn't say ""he"" made all things, it says ""it"" made all things. The relative pronouns used in John 1:2-4 are houtos and autos, each just refer back to the subject. The subject is the logos, which isn't a person. The Logos is *never* a person in John's gospel. Compare John 6:60. You find the logos, and the exact same relative pronouns in the same form. The Logos isn't a prehuman Jesus, it's the word God speaks. Again, follow the links, this is all broken down easy for you even if you don't read any Greek.

3. John 1:3 is that the new creation begins with the word of the gospel. The Logos is the gospel, Luke 8:11. Just as God created all things by what *he* spoke in Genesis 1:3, God creates all things anew by what he spoke through Jesus. Jesus himself says over and over ""the words I speak are not mine, but the Father's who sent me"" (John 14:24). God created all things in the beginning by himself. One person alone, and that is the Father of Israel. God our Father. Malachi 2:10. John 1:3 isn't contradicting this or adding Jesus to the mix. It isn't even about Genesis creation as the posts explain.

The short answer of Colossians 1:16:

1. Creation of all things in Colossians 1:16 are the things created ""in him."" Was Genesis creation ""in Christ?"" No. Otherwise it wouldn't need to be reconciled to him. You can't ignore this Pauline phrase, it's in the text for a reason. Creation is ""in"" Christ, and Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5:17 ""anything *in Christ* is a new creation."" It's obvious that Colossians 1:16 is about what is created in the new creation.

2. Context makes it clear. Colossians 1:13-14 are necessarily about after Jesus' death, verse 15 is in the present tense (who *is* the image if God, not ""who was""). Verse 18 tells you that the beginning of this creation is when Jesus is born from the death. And verses 19 ff tell you this is about reconciliation. You have to be blind not to realize this is about new creation.

3. Context also tells you that new creation is what God is creating in and through Christ. And the entire chapter is about Jesus and his kingdom. There was no kingdom of Christ in Genesis, nor was there Christ reigning at the right hand of the Father. This necessarily comes after his death (see Daniel 7, Philippians 2:8-11, Revelation 4, Acts 2, etc etc).

No, Colossians 1 isn't saying Jesus created back in Genesis either. It doesn't say ""Jesus created the heavens and the earth."" It says ""whether things *in* heaven and things *on* earth,"" because new creation is to reconcile the old. The things in heaven and on earth which have fallen. Sorry but this supposed contradiction you're pointing out has already been dealt with, and it also doesn't stand up to a basic reading. You have no excuse either, there's a ton of info up there for you to find this out on your own without any excuse. These posts are months old because these have been being dealt with for ages. You think you're the first person to try and make this argument? Not hardly."
isuvlky,ArchaicChaos,y7ff52,I would again like to point out how much you're dodging difficult problems for your own view by trying to bring up some other issue. Whether I believe in the Trinity or not is irrelevant to the fact that you've both made a bad argument and not been able to resolve your issues.
isy2364,AccomplishedAuthor3,y7ff52,"Again, you said God was ""alone"" when He made everything ...

>Isaiah 44:24 says that God made everything by himself. With no one else. God is one self. One person. With no other persons did he create anything.

God told Isaiah He was all alone, so even though that's  true,  there's more to the story.  God wasn't ever really  alone, yet He is absolutely alone in the fact that He is  the One and Only God.   You have to take into account *all* of the scriptures not just those that appear on the surface to back up your theory that the Word was only involved in the new creation. That's an impossible theory

When John wrote that ""In the beginning was the Word...""  what beginning do you suppose that was?  ""The Word was with God...""  in the beginning so here we see God claiming He is  alone and  Isaiah would have assumed what most people would, but it wasn't all there was to know about God's nature, only that He is One God.  John tells more of the story when he writes ""nothing"" was made without the Word. What part of ""nothing"" is hard to understand. ""No thing""Nothing, not one solitary thing,  was made without the Word.  Implying that the Word was involved only in  the 'new' creation is absolutely absurd because the new creation would not be created until Jesus was born, lived, died and then rose from the dead.   John is writing about Christ's pre-human existence and nobody disputes that. That would be pre-new creation.  Long before the new creation ever was. Jesus told the Pharisees, ""Before Abraham was born, I Am""

God was, and still is, all  alone as far as being the One True God. He is God and there are no others. ""In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God...""----so even though God is the only God, He isn't alone *within* Himself ""...the Word *was* God"",   He is only alone as far as being the One True God, but in Him was always His Word and the Word was always in God.    This is the only way both the new testament and the old can be harmonized in the fact that Christ and YHWH  are  the One True God

>The text doesn't say ""he"" made all things, it says ""it"" made all things....The Logos is never a person in John's gospel. Compare John 6:60.

That's heresy.  The Logos is the Word and the Word was made flesh

*""****He \[not it****\] was with God in the beginning.  Through* ***him\[not it\]***  *all things were made; without* ***him \[not it\]*** *nothing was made that has been made.* ***In him\[not it\]***  *was life, and* ***that life*** *was the light of all mankind.   The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.""*  John 1:2-5That includes the Watchtower's darkness if that's your religious persuasion.

&#x200B;

# He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. ...The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. John 1:10,14

It?   That's just ridiculous. Read the Bible a bit more and  the Watchtower a bit less   ;)"
isuxosv,Siege_Bay,y7ff52,"I don't think any of your arguments are any good, on top of the fact that they are unnecessarily long. 

It's really simple. There is only One Savior. God. No one else. There is no Savior besides God. If you acknowledge Jesus as Savior, then it logically follows that He is God since only God can be the Savior. 

The Father is not Jesus, but both are the One Being, God. Not the same Person, but same Being."

isvgq68,Relevant-Ranger-7849,y7jbuy,everything happens in order. there is no skipping around. the antichrist will appear first. and we are not even at this point for the black horse to come. the first horse is the white horse which is the antichrist coming on. or being symbolized by. He comes before the others and they all come when the seals are broken. The Four Horsemen correspond with the first four seals opened by the Lamb as He opens the scroll of judgment in heaven (see Revelation 5). we have to have the rapture first. so no
isvtxtz,KingMoomyMoomy,y7jbuy,"I personally feel a strong case can be made that each seal is an event in each year of Daniels 70th week.  It could get lengthy explaining why with all the OT cross references. So I’ll try to summarize. Starting with idea that white horse rider is “given a crown”. (There is a particular monarch that intends on normalizing with Israel as soon as he officially becomes king btw..). But nevertheless this is imagery of the antichrist. There’s a false peace then sometime in year 2 peace is robbed. By year 3 we have the massive inflation for food.  At the midpoint in the 4th year/seal (3.5 years in) we have the abomination of desolation. You can see in Ezekiel 5 the 4th horsemen is in response to the abominations in the temple. 

“And because of all your abominations I will do with you what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again. Therefore, as I live, declares the Lord God, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will withdraw. My eye will not spare, and I will have no pity. I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children. Pestilence and blood shall pass through you, and I will bring the sword upon you. I am the Lord; I have spoken.””
‭‭Ezekiel‬ ‭5‬:‭9‬, ‭11‬, ‭17‬ ‭ESV‬‬ 

Seal 5 is the view of the martyrs in heaven waiting for the number to be complete. 
Seal 6- by year 6 martyrdom is spread to a multitude from every nation and it is complete. The sky is darkened and stars begin falling for trumpet judgments. 
Seal 7 is final year of stars hitting earth with plagues ending in the last trumpet at Christ return.

isw1b1r,The_Real_Baldero,y7jbuy,"This is a valid possibility for sure.  I'm glad there's someone proposing alternative, far more historically orthodox views.  For 1800 years the church was almost exclusively covenantal in its theology.  John Darby didn't introduce dispensationalism until the 1800's.  

For a brief primer on covenant theology, [here's a great article](https://www.ligonier.org/learn/articles/dispensationalism).  I grew up dispensationalist, pre-7-year-tribulation literal thousand year reign, etc. etc.  It wasn't until I stumbled upon covenant theology that Scripture made so much more sense.  It completely blew my mind that the majority of Christians for nearly 2 millennia held to covenant theology (albeit with a Catholic flavor until Martin Luther, who still maintained a covenant view of redemptive history), and that *my ironclad theology* was an interpretation barely 200 years old.  

I admit some claims of dispensationalism make sense, but Yahweh is a God of covenants that are never broken.  In my mind, the system only provides fertile ground for conspiracy theories that don't actually help us live more like Christ but rather like tabloid scouring fortune tellers hanging on every world headline like *it's finally happening*, which is *exactly* what dispensationalists have done ever since Darby."

isutq1y,CheeseburgerBrown,y7jarm,Famine is a promise of the climate crisis. It's engineered by our collective ongoing indifference.
isuve0z,RebelPoetically,y7jarm,"God told so many of our brethren global famine is coming and I had warned months ago. The Mod’s removed my posts and people got offended for the truth. Now every nation is reporting we have less than 20-40 weeks of wheat globally left. It used to be 70 weeks

Farmers in America report wells are dried up and lakes like Lake Powell are at critical. They found metals in the dry lakes that form naturally and the scientist fear a great dust ball will occur soon and the metals will cause health issues 

The Atheist’s pretend God was speaking about a small minor issue. Pay them no heed I say. Why pay them no heed? Because every major prophecy God has given us is almost nearly fulfilled.

God gave us 300+ messages about things to come. He said when Israel became a nation again it would be a sign of end times. Israel became a nation again after the Holocaust.

God also mentioned the six day war and it occurred too. I can say alot about what Israel is doing right now which shows were at the end but instead go look yourself. Go on YouTube and Google and check to see what Israel is doing.

Also look at Euphrates river on YouTube and Google then open Revelation’s and book of Daniel and see what God said about Euphrates.

The non believers, Atheist, and even Christians are very blind. But you make valid points, there is no fear in Christ. And good things like revival and more God says would come. 

Pm me op, let’s share sources and notes and edify each other, I love speaking with people so educated in God’s truth and someone who see’s God’s truths today is always someone who will bless a person looking for it. So let’s pm and we can talk about this unimpeded.

God bless and thanks for sharing, Maranatha! The Blessed Hope we wait for will come!"
isv08hp,Close-to-Jesus,y7jarm,"Well, I'm not a doomsday prepper.  I don't have a bunker in my backyard, but I do have a long-term storage pantry for the safety of my family as you never know when a natural or financial disaster might strike.  To me, that's just good sense :)  I don't have the budget for a 5-year food supply and if that truly becomes needed, I will pray God will make a way for me."
isuukxe,Close-to-Jesus,y7jarm,"My personal belief is the coming famine is the result of more than just the climate.  The world has gone through cycles for thousands of years that were much more severe than this one (however I'm not disagreeing that we shouldn't be more climate-conscious).  However, right now I also believe we have governments actively working to bring about things like this as a method of control and to usher in the one world government.  I could always be wrong, just my take on it."
isv21h0,eversnowe,y7jarm,"My grandpa believed the pastors who said Y2K would cause an economic collapse, so he hoarded food for ages. That's all he ever talked about - the end of the world. But Y2K came and went without incident. Most of the food expired before he could eat it all. I've seen this rodeo before and I'm not buying the sham ticket. Being ready for a disaster is normal.

iswxo79,OirishM,y7jarm,"The problem is more likely the dude who invaded one of the largest grain producers on the planet, and there isn't likely to be a one world government with him about. Reality is problematic enough without bringing in crankism"
isuvrci,RebelPoetically,y7jarm,"These people are who God warns of when he says they have darkened eyes and can’t see the light. The history of this world shows these modern event’s did not occur like how we see it occur in the past and they rather ignore because the truth hurts.

Keep your head up king, the truth remains true even when people attack it or reject it. Let them face the consequences for ignoring the truth of purpose after you’ve been kind to give it. And Pm me, the mod’s love to remove the truth sometimes so in private we can talk and edify each other."
isuzxbb,Close-to-Jesus,y7jarm,"No, I'm not one of the groups that believes in lizard men or aliens, I'm simply alert enough to watch multiple news sources (not just the mainstream media) and see for myself what's going on.  I don't have to fabricate it.  But regardless, I will still love you with the love of the Lord and not be disrespectful to you.  You're certainly entitled to your opinion.  God bless."

iq4mz2y,MadTrophyWife,xp62ry,"I mean, define ""fair?"" I think ""Fair"" is for you and DH to live in peace. DH deserves to attend his father's funeral if he can and then he deserves to be no contact for as long as he jolly well pleases after. If it's any consolation, she'll probably say something at the funeral that would restart the 6 months anyway. MF is not going to behave herself.  


Listen. Let him tell you what he needs. Take small things off his plate. Do the dishes on his night, take the trash cans to the curb, whatever. Small acts that make his life a tiny bit easier when it's really hard are a good way to start. And remind him that making choices for his own welfare is valid and you support that whether it means going or staying home."
iq4kjv5,nappingpanda123,xp62ry,Let him go to the funeral. He doesn’t want to deal with his mother either so tell him to be short & distant with her.
iq4g2po,MissingInAction01,xp62ry,"My FIL died suddenly last year, but we luckily didn't have to deal much with MIL because they were divorced.  She did come to the funeral because my SIL has a love/hate relationship with her (similar to my DH's relationship before she went nuclear for the 3rd time and we went NC).  I am so sorry for your (you and DHs) loss. Fil was DH's best friend too. He was his best man in our wedding. We unfortunately lost his other groomsman to chronic issues a few months later. 


Focus on what you and DH want out of this. I'm assuming recognizing FILs life and his importance to you, but this is for you to decide. MF is going to hoot and hollar and generally be herself. You can't control her behavior. But you can control how much of it you tolerate/deal with. Please give yourself permission to walk out of rooms, end conversations, etc. if it is more than you can handle at that moment.


As for a restart of NC, what makes the most sense for you and your family? Do that. Do you even want to re-establish contact with MF after a period of NC now that she can't gatekeep anymore? Things to think about, not questions to answer now."
iq3thuw,Interesting-Sky-1865,xp62ry,"Hey, me again. Just follow his lead. Try not to be anxious. I know it's easier said than done but at this point, what can you do? Lots of hugs to you both."
iq3mclr,blackbird828,xp62ry,">I don't know how to support him. 

You let him grieve and make the best decisions he can right now. Trying to apply your complicated NC rules isn't necessary. His father died. This is a once in a lifetime loss, and he has the right to grieve in whatever way he needs to as long as he isn't hurting anyone. Support him by stepping back."
iq41j28,hisimpendingbaldness,xp62ry,"Support him, by supporting him.  Hold his hand rub his back.  Let him know you are there for him.    Honestly that is a separate issue from dealing with MIL.

If you can work it out let him go to the funeral, fly in the day before, fly out the day after, rent a car so he isn't dependent on them, and he isn't intruding on the funeral set up time.   When he comes home deal with how to deal with MIL moving forward.   One war at a time, get through the funeral first.

My condolences to your husband on his loss."
iq3mqk5,MountainLiving5673,xp62ry,"Please try to respect whatever your DH needs in this time, regardless of how you feel about the interactions.  This is two losses, both his father and the hope he had for what his relationship with his father could be.  If he wants/needs to pretend things are ""normal"" for the funeral and with the group chat, that is fine.  Our boundaries can't be rigid or we lose our own choices."
iq2kncv,reallynah75,xp62ry,"I'm so sorry for your loss. 

Imho, I think that SO should go to the funeral. If he doesn't, he could start to regret it. And from regret, resentment could grow. Plus, he needs to be able to grieve and say goodbye. For himself. You all can reset the timeout whenever you want to. Before the funeral, after the funeral, during the funeral. Whatever works best for you."
iq2zr2g,Ran_dom_1,xp62ry,"I’m sorry, OP. Other than trying to make your home calm, & a safe place for DH to talk & show his emotions, there’s not a lot you can do. You could try looking into ways he could get to the funeral, any possible ways to cut the cost. It’s heartbreaking that his immediate thought was that he can’t afford it. 

If he does go, suggest that he try to visit the funeral home the day before the service, or in the morning the day of it. Typically if there’s a viewing, the family will be offered to see the person, giving them a chance to approve of the appearance the morning of the service. He’d have to avoid that time, if he wants privacy. 

DH could call the funeral home, ask to speak to the director, tell him/her that there are some family issues, & when would be a good time for him to have a few minutes alone with his Dad.  If you’re both going to make the financial sacrifice of him going, I’d do this to make sure DH gets the private goodbye he needs. Without his Mom‘s drama or interference.

If he can’t go, he could ask if they show the service online. Maybe he could take the day off from work, & at least feel like he didn’t miss everything. I really hope he’s able to get there, saw where you said his Dad was his best friend. This is such a tough loss, I’m so sorry."
iq3hgby,SMDmonster,xp62ry,"I’m so sorry for you both. The best way I can think to support hi is what my wife has done for me. Watch his favorite movie with him, find his favorite snack, let him cry, vent, or what ever his emotions need. Keep the wound of grief lanced and show him kindness. Today it’s all the small gifts that will matter."
iq3wqq7,Acrobatic-Job5702,xp62ry,"The 6 month restarting thing seems silly to me. You’ve been trying it for 2 years. It’s obviously not working. He should go to the funeral if he wants to in order to mourn and support his sister, but after that you need to have a serious talk about finding a better solution."
iq2nqsy,MissIllusion,xp62ry,"If he can't go to the funeral, can he talk to the funeral home into having a live stream available?"
iq2npd4,CatsCubsParrothead,xp62ry,"Let him know, verbally tell him, that whatever decision he comes to, you will back him completely. Yeah, he probably already knows that, but sometimes actually hearing it out loud can be reassuring and comforting. Other than that, just be present for him, however he needs your support. Maybe he wants to talk about his dad, so listen. Maybe he just wants to sit and remember, so sit quietly with him. If you're not sure, gently ask him if there's something you can do to help be there for him. Let him take the lead on this.

Let him honour his father. However... I'm just going to warn you, this is only the beginning. You shoukd rather focus on planning how you are going to handle the aftermath of this: who is going to do the admin related to accounts and winding yo the estate etc, bevause I can guarantee you your MIL is going to milk the ""grieving widow"" card for all eternity... you're also going to have think about how you're going to handle her up and coming ""depression"" even after all the admin and the fuss is over, she's going to pull the ""i can't live anymore"" thing """"because I'm a widow"".... etc etc... which grated there has been a loss but she is absolutely going to use this an an opportunity to interfere with children lives and she is going to become completely reliant on them; like ""i can't drive to get groceries because husband used to drive me and I don't drive and now I can't eat...I need help"" etc etc.... think longer term here."

“There seems to be a miscommunication here.  I have informed you that I’m unable to attend the funeral.  I have phoned you, mom, and passed on my condolences.  I shouldn’t be in this group chat.

So that everyone is on the same page,  these sad circumstances doesn’t change my relationship with you.  

Mom has caused too much damage to my relationship with her.  And, no, Dads death doesn’t change moms behaviour, it’s likely to make it worse.

In addition, I feel that if mom communicate with my whilst I’m grieving, it’ll make things much worse for our relationship.  As I wont be tolerating any bad behaviour whatsoever.  So in respect for what small shreds of relationship we have left, I ask you all to take a step back and not involve me.

She is both grieving her husband and manipulating the situation. Neither of us knows what to do.

Sorry, this just adds stress.   I would suggest doing whats less stressful for dh.  He and you need to decide that.  My recommendation is on what I would find less stressful in your situation,  but every human is different.

Then Uber away, the point is to not be dependent on MIL for anything,  rides to and from or anything.   If Uber is better for that, use Uber.  Just don't let her talk him into giving him rides"

isxgx5h,ironicalusername,y7o90x,"I took a couple university classes on the bible- it was very interesting.  Very different from the devotional perspective, which is the only approach most people have ever taken to this material.    My main previous exposure to any kind of bible instruction had been as a kid in sunday school.  But looking back- we learned bible stories.  We didn't learn much of anything ABOUT the bible.  Which is understandable, for kids, but as adults, we can go so much further. 

One of foundational things to think about is what is your goal?  Do you care who wrote the bible, when, and why?  Do you want to try to delve into what it meant to its authors and/or original audience?   Or, do you want to focus on how modern Christians interpret the bible? 

One thing I have noticed here that many people here are reluctant to do is to _let each author speak for themselves_.   For one classic example, in the story of Adam and Eve, Satan tempted Eve to eat the fruit, right?  Well, yes, according to later interpretations.  But if we let the story speak for itself, we can see that Satan is not a character in it.  There's no hint _in that story_ that the serpent is secretly something else- this is a re-interpretation that was developed later.  I'm not saying this to claim that interpretation is right or wrong, I'm just saying it goes beyond what is written in the story."

iszhq5t,ironicalusername,y7o90x,"It's one of my favorite examples of the different between the text itself and interpretations of the text.  You don't have to be a scholar to study this bit, and it's a fun way to re-look at a familiar story.

There's a few things which IMO do not make sense in the story, if the serpent is satan.

First, 
>>Now the serpent was more crafty than any other wild animal that the Lord God had made.

This lumps the critter in with the wild animals.  Satan pretending to be a snake is NOT a wild animal.

Second, 
>>Because you have done this, cursed are you among all animals and among all wild creatures; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life""

This is an etiological tale about why snakes lack legs.  Well, why would God have punished actual animals for something Satan did while pretending to be an animal?  God would not be tricked like that, it makes little sense.

Third,
>>I will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers; he will strike your head,  and you will strike his heel.

This makes more sense talking about actual snakes than it does about Satan.  Satan doesn't have offspring, but snakes sure do.   People really do hit snakes in the head to kill them, and snakes really do bite people's feet.  Nobody ever hit Satan in the head, and Satan is not a foot-biter, as far as I am aware.  

Now, does this mean Christianity is terrible and wrong and they have wildly misconstrued the bible?  Of course not.  But it does mean that we can closely examine these texts, even us lay people reading English translations, and draw conclusions about these stories.  To the authors and original audience of this story, there was no Satan there - the snake is a wild animal.

Not every common Christian story is _accurately_ based on the biblical texts, and that's OK.  The bible is important to Christianity of course, and church tradition is also important.   If Satan is important to your theology, you can still have your Satan, even if the snake is just a snake.  The traditional Christmas story can't be found in any biblical text either, and that's also OK.  The text is the text.  Traditions are traditional."
ira7d8m,CrBr,xx3w7w,"Privacy is not guaranteed. People often post old diaries here, and we read them easily.  Gregg was a very popular system, so it's even easier to find readers.

Gregg shorthand only saves space if you write it smaller than standard. Gregg rule notebooks are about 8 mm, normal college rule is about 7. My journal is college ruled and I double space. You can write Gregg smaller, so you can single space. That does save paper, but my hand doesn't like it. Writing Gregg in the margins of a book takes practice. Each shape has 3 sizes. If you shrink the largest size, you have to shrink all 3.

(Some teachers say smaller is faster. That's not true. Championship writers vary from microscopic to double size. One even made special large size notebooks. Too small means you have to write more carefully. Close your eyes, write a sentence, and see what size your hand likes.)

Gregg-shorthand.com has a list of Gregg versions by date. In general, newer systems are faster to learn, but lower top speed -- but unless you work hard at it, most of your speed loss is due to hesitation and not knowing the system well. If you know an older version, you can read the newer ones.

Anniversary is out of copyright and has a lot of free resources online. The main textbook is very short because it doesn't have much practice material but there are supplementary books. It is fairly complicated.

I would start by quickly reading the Anniversary manual. Many rules that don't make sense in Simplified do make sense in Anniversary. Example, changing the direction of the circle adds an R sound in Anniversary. In Simplified, the instructions for circle direction look like an unnecessary complexity if you don't know the reason.

If you're comfortable with Anniversary's level of complexity and memory load, go back and study it properly from page one.

Simplified is easier to learn. It's still under copyright, so you have to buy the manuals used. The basic manual has a good amount of practice material. The Functional manual has even more. Anniversary was for high-speed reporting. Then steno machines became popular for high-speed use, and they changed the target market to office workers, who could ask people to repeat themselves.

Don't judge complexity by book length. Anniversary is more complicated but has a tiny manual because there's hardly any practice material.

Simplified to DJS is a small step.

The newer versions are a bit longer to write but even easier to read. I haven't looked at them.

Most shorthands can 100wpm, even ones that have a lot of strokes. Toastmasters recommends 100 to 120 for formal speeches. Legal reporters have to do over 200. 80 is typical for a boss who will slow down if you ask. Longhand is usually between 20 and 60. 20 was enough to pass a hundred hour typing class in high school, and 60 to 80 was required to be hired as a junior typist.

20 minutes a day for 6 months is enough to learn the system and write faster than longhand, if you do it wisely. Simply copying the examples slowly won't help. 100 hours to reach 100wpm is typical if you have a skilled teacher and study efficiently and have some natural skill. Writing shorthand is rewiring your brain, just like learning to play an instrument or sport.

Start by reading the entire manual, including the examples. Only writes words you've already studied, until you know all the theory. Shorthand is a lot more than writing the sounds. A lot of information is left of, and including unnecessary information can make it a different word.

Someone posted a link to an article about speed building with the machine shorthand this week. Most applies to pen shorthand. Swemm wrote an article about systematic speed building, which is also online. It starts after you know the theory well, but I used it when learning. In general, learning this theory is most important, then comes accuracy. Spend most of your time practicing just above your comfort level so you don't get complacent, a good chunk of time below it to get accuracy, and occasionally go way above it to break out of a speed block and learn which words you need to practice more. 

Always reread your notes, so you catch problems and don't reinforce them. Practice does not make perfect. Practice makes permanent. I divide two facing pages in my notebook into columns, so four columns are in front of me. First one is copied from the textbook, but then I copy from each column to the next, so each passage is copied four times and practice reading my own notes. At least one column is we can quickly and another slowly for accuracy, but I'm not consistent which order. I usually do a whole chapter for column one, then put away the textbook and just work from my notebook."
ira6g77,gordonramsme2,xx3w7w,"(https://www.forgottenbooks.com/en/download/GreggShorthand_10268993.pdf) here’s the actual Gregg shorthand book, it takes way way longer than six months, like maybe a year or two depending on how how continuously you are learning, that’s what I’ve heard from everyone who knows Gregg shorthand and in my opinion 20 minutes a day is not nearly enough if you want to learn in six months, this is almost exactly like learning a whole new language which takes a LOT of time and dedication."
irbpbwz,drabbiticus,xx3w7w,"Welcome! Thank you for your kind words about the Gregg - we certainly like it here and I quite also love the way it looks!

If you are curious, the easiest way to figure out if you might enjoy it is just to try it. The basic alphabet is quite easy to learn in theory and can be seen here: https://greggshorthand.github.io/images/alphabet.gif. If you just wanted a secret code and to learn something fast, you can just learn the shapes for the letters and make up your own ways to join them, but I wouldn't use it for anything truly important to you. A number of English letters are missing from the Gregg alphabet since it was designed to be written by sound and you would be making some things up as you go to figure out how to represent certain things.

To learn the system as intended, you would want to learn the various rules for how to join the letters together since most of the time the strokes join into 1 shape, or 1 closely-spaced shape set, for each word. A poem giving a succinct summary of those rules for the 1916 version of Gregg is here https://i.imgur.com/GwD6LMQ.jpg. Some of those rules were removed in later editions to reduce the amount of rules that had to be learned. There also also a bunch of ways devised to represent certain common combinations of letters/sounds, and ways to abbreviate common word prefixes/suffixes. Different Gregg editions have differing numbers of those methods, with later ones typically spelling things out more fully. To get a sense of some of those methods, see https://greggshorthand.github.io/images/synopann.gif for the overview of the 1929 version (Anniversary). It looks long, but a lot of those make sense once you know the alphabet, like using ""m"" at the end for ""ment"", etc. What edition is right for you depends on how well abbreviations and such things stick in your head, but based on your post it sounds like you might prefer a more fully written style that hopefully could be learned with less memorization.

The DJS (1963) Manual can be found here https://archive.org/details/greggshorthanddi00gre_15n/mode/2up. There is also a ""functional method"" book here https://archive.org/details/greggshorthandfu00greg/page/n7/mode/2up. Basically functional method is a different way to learn the system and emphasizes just learning to read first and engraining the shapes of common words into your mind before you ever write. I never learned from the functional method, but flipping through it looks like a very friendly, very easy way to preview the system. The Anniversary manual, which more heavily relies on various methods of abbreviation, can be found at https://greggshorthand.github.io/anunit01.html for comparison.

Realistically, the theory was generally taught over roughly half a school year. If you got really into it and devoted more than 20 minutes daily, you could certainly go through it much faster than that, but that would just be for learning what the theory says. Because shorthand is really more of an applied skill, actually learning to apply that theory to forming words takes longer than simply reading the chapter and being able to say what the rule is. After you learn all the theory, you have learned the requisite knowledge to figure out how you would write any English word in Gregg. However, since English is not spelled by sound, every time you come across a word you haven't written or read in Gregg before, you will have to construct or deconstruct the outline and that will incur a bit of a time cost until you truly learn that shorthand word. This vocabulary problem is true no matter which version of Gregg you use and will constitute a significant chunk of practice before you begin to feel truly confident in writing most words you come across.

In order to reach ""vocational"" speeds of 80+ wpm on a broad range of subject matter, most high school students took closer to 2 years of instruction. There are definitely students who went faster, and there are going to be people on this subreddit that progressed (much?) faster or slower in their self-study, but that's kind of a reasonable place to set your expectations. If you find the process enjoyable and fun, none of that time will be wasted! However, if the idea of puzzling out a shorthand outlines sounds more like work than fun, the effort/benefit ratio may not be a good fit for your desires. Try your hand at the strokes, flip through the books and get a sense of what's going to feel right for you."

Some shorthands are more linear and fit well on one line. Forkner and Ponish are the two I know. Do try the closed-eye test, though, several times, as you get used to writing it. For speed, use the size your hand likes. I find slower is smaller because there's not as much room for error. Orthic is easier to write tiny since the large size is rare. (Page 1 says only 1 sizes. Then you reach the advanced stage, and they admit to the large size. But there are only 2 sizes of circles. Normally. Some use a middle circle for some large circles, to make reading faster.)"

isw61cr,the_celt_,y7fpb3,"""Fulfilled"" doesn't have anything to do with ""ending"" when it comes to laws.  Christians say it all the time, but my best guess for how an honest person could get it wrong (and not all Christians are arguing honestly) is that they're conflating ""Covenant"" with ""Law"".

A covenant is an agreement, similar to marriage vows.  Both sides agree to do something for each other (and it doesn't have to be the same thing).  When you fulfill a covenant, by doing the thing you promised, you end it.  

A law is something like a stop sign.  When you fulfill a Law, you **do** it.  You meet the requirements of it.   Stopping at a stop sign fulfills the requirements of that stop sign, but it doesn't make the stop sign go away, no matter how many times you perfectly stop at it.  That's just now how laws work.

Jesus obeyed the Law perfectly, but that doesn't make the Law go away, and thus he directly said that he DID NOT COME TO MAKE IT GO AWAY.  He could not have been any more clear about it.  He went on to say that it would never go away, or change in the slightest, until Heaven and Earth passed away first.

Look around:  Heaven and Earth?  Still here?  Same for the Law."
isudlvu,Siege_Bay,y7fpb3,"Paul reveals that the Law was never meant to save, but to show us our sinfulness. 

Jesus brought up the Law because the rich man had a skewed view of ""good"" and thought he himself had kept the entire Law, which no one actually can. Jesus was showing the young man that he had sinned and fallen short by bringing up commandments. The young man loved his riches too much, you could say more than God, breaking the greatest commandment and walked away. 

I would encourage you to read the end of Romans 13 after the government part. Paul sums up in that if we follow the 2 greatest commandments, then in essence we will be keeping the Law because the Law and prophets hang on those 2. 

As far as food, Jesus declared all things clean. As far as ceremonial laws, we have the New Covenant that was promised in the Old Covenant. So the OT actually foretold that it wouldn't last forever but give way to a better and lasting covenant."
isv9ruf,FreedomNinja1776,y7fpb3,"u/Animore

Have a look at this. The Greek word pleroo definition:
https://www.reddit.com/user/FreedomNinja1776/comments/y2g8o4/pleroo

Nothing there about ""ending"" the law. Everything is about bringing it to it's fullest meaning. Messiah fulfilled the law by being our perfect example of how to walk it out in our lives. We are to emulate him. Look at the rest of the verse. 

>>“Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
>>Matthew 5:17‭-‬20 ESV

Questions for you:
1. Why does Christ say he didn't come to abolish the law or prophets then say immediately say he ""fulfills"" them, if fulfill means to end?

2. Why does he bring up heaven and earth? When do they pass away? Have they passed away? Is this the same earth Jesus walked on?

3. He says not the smallest thing will change from the law until all is accomplished. When is that?

4. Jesus says whoever relaxes the smallest command will be called LEAST. Does that sound like he's saying good job?

5. Jesus says whoever does and teaches them will be called GREAT. Or, does this sound like he's saying good job?


https://www.reddit.com/user/FreedomNinja1776/comments/uryyw1/two_commands_example

This is a good visual example of how all the law and prophets hang on the two great commands of love God and love your neighbor. Look at your the 10 commandments are divided. First 4, love God, next 6 love neighbor. Each of the instructions to follow in the mosaic law fall into one of these 10 categories."

isym267,firefighter1811,y7fpb3,"So why are you concerned about the law?  We as gentiles were never under the law. The law was ONLY for the Jews!  Now we ""gentile born again believers"" have only one law,  That is to love one another as Jesus loves us!

John 13:34-35    
34  A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.   
35  By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”"
isuha2k,paul_1149,y7fpb3,"I believe Jesus was probing the rich young ruler, or more precisely, was guiding him to probe himself. Was he truly righteous as he thought he was? When the man maintained his righteousness in the face of Jesus' questions, Jesus then challenged him further, as to godliness and consecration to God. The letter of the law can only do so much. Jesus now showed him the way to exceed the letter, which he would have to do in order to be ""perfect"". And the man failed the test.

2Cor 3 deals with the issue you are struggling with. There Paul says our new covenant is not of the letter, but of the spirit, because the letter kills but the spirit gives life. Elsewhere Paul explains that the law is holy and good, but sin within our makeup takes advantage of it and uses it to condemn us. So ultimately there is no salvation in the law. It is merely the tutor that leads men to their need of a Savior. (see 1Cor 15.56, Gal 3.24)

And so the principles the commandments are based on retain their validity, but we are not bound to them for the purpose of achieving righteousness. That can only be obtained as a free gift from the only One who has earned the right to confer it, the One who gave Himself on our behalf."
isugeo8,ArchaicChaos,y7fpb3,"Idk exactly what you know or don't know about the topic, so I may explain too much. But I'd rather say too much than too little.

In the life of Jesus, the old law was still in effect. Jews needed to follow the old law while Jesus was alive and so yes he would tell anyone to follow these laws. It is at his death on the cross that the ""writings against us,"" that is, the old law, was destroyed along with the body of Christ (Colossians 2:14). Jesus fulfills the law in his resurrection, not his ministry. But in his ministry, he's preparing us for the new law of the spirit. Take his sermon on the mount for example. He's giving a new law from the mountain top, as an obvious typology of Moses. This is a common literary device of Matthew, noting also the situation of Christ as a child, seeking to be killed as a baby by a tyrant. The same was the case for baby Moses. Just as Moses gave the old law from Mount Sinai and now Jesus gives a new law. Listen to what he says. ""You have heard it said that you must not X (commit adultery), but I say to you Y (do not even look at a woman)."" He's teaching us what the Spirit of the law is. When he dies and the letter of the law and the covenant is broken, like a marriage covenant (See Romans 7), but the Spirit of the law is now what reigns over those in a spiritual contract with God. The new covenant.

The old law and following the letter of the law is a tutor, as Paul says in Galatians. It's what we do when we are learning. It teaches us how to obey the spirit. The old law was not bad. The problem with it was our flesh. Our sin was the problem of the old law. The new covenant of spirit is without flesh. We can be freed from sin, justified, by the new covenant. Paul says that if the old law could justify, then ""Christ died needlessly."" Never let it be so. We don't need a law written in ink to tell us how to love God and not sin. We have a law written on our hearts, of the Holy Spirit. That's something the old law couldn't do. 

Yes, Jesus said the whole of the law is to love God and to love neighbour. Paul said the whole of the law is to love your neighbour. Did Paul forget part of the law? Did Jesus forget part of the law? No. To love your neighbour is how you show that you love God. You can't give God anything. But He asks us to love each other. That's how we love God. How do we keep the spirit of the law? To love. Love never fails.

The old law is a shadow of the new. When we read about the levitical priesthood and how they needed to clean themselves and present sacrifices to just approach God, it was a shadow of a greater reality. It demonstrates that we can't approach God in our fallen sinful state. Sacrifices of blood and the pouring out of life, a ministry of death, that could only hope to come remotely close to being in the presence of God. When we are washed clean, the presence of God is in us. God and Christ make their home in the hearts of true believers by the Spirit (John 14). So I think we need to understand the proper place of the old law, and this should help us answer questions. The answer is never to return to the old law. The substance of that shadow is Christ. If we have Christ, something greater than the old law is here. If we ask why Jesus held the law and taught the law, it is because God's covenant with Israel was still in effect. If we wish to know what purpose the old law had, it was to show us the greatness of the new law. The letter to the Hebrews is entirely about this issue."
isv9mrj,first_time_internet,y7fpb3,"The commandments still apply. 

Jesus was the goal of the law meaning he was the only one to live it out fully. 

It still applies, and is our goal as well.

He took the place of the sacrifice and the high priest.

isvv7ts,DubDeuceInThisBih,y7fpb3,"the commandments are the entire point of the book.  the bible continuously drums this in as you read.  In fact, ""love"" in the bible just means to keep the commandments.  over 600 of them."
isudvmu,captgoldberg,y7fpb3,"I am pondering another question: why does a self-described agnostic care about this question, or its answer?"
isvq9dl,onlyonetruthm8,y7fpb3,"The commandments are God's law which we are to live by.   

The whole point of the law was to provide a way to attain righteousness (Deuteronomy 6, 24.or 25 about there.)  Only Jesus did it and offers us his righteousness through the forgiveness of sins.   Those who live by the law have not accepted the righteousness offered by Jesus and so still are judged by the law.  They can not become righteous that way.   Jesus was the only one who did it.  
Only the righteous will remain with God in the next life.  So It is actually impossible without Jesus."
it2c5tt,Traditional_Bell7883,y7fpb3,"Why should it be assumed that God gave only one law to all humans regardless of space and time? God has given different laws to different groups of people across different times (see Heb. 1:1-2 ""at many times and various manners""; Eph. 1:21 ""this age but also that which is to come""; Col. 1:26 ""the mystery which has been hidden from ages (plural, i.e. at least 2 ages)""). How many dispensations are there? The Bible doesn't say, but from Eph. 1:21 and Col. 1:26 read together, one can deduce that there are at least four dispensations. One needs to analyse the nature of each of the covenants in scripture to come to an effective understanding on whether it was conditional or unconditional, temporal or permanent -- were they Royal Grant, Suzerain-Vassal, etc. The Mosaic Law, a Suzerain-Vassal type of covenant was given to the Israelites and was not a perpetual covenant. 

One good indication of there being more than one law from God is in Romans 8:2: ""For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death"". Two laws are mentioned and contrasted in the same verse! So there are at least two laws! It says that one law has made us free from the other law. It is odd that so many are unable to accept the possibility of more than one law of God and insist on the Mosaic Law as if it is the only law ever given by God. 1 Cor. 9:21 is another verse that mentions two laws in the same verse.

That doesn't mean that God is inconsistent. It has nothing to do with God being unchanging. Of course, God is unchanging, but He has had to deal with different groups of people with finite lives in the unfolding of history, at different places and at different points in time. Just as my wife would tell my four-year-old daughter Emma ""don't go near the stove at all"", and tell my adult son ""you may use the stove to cook your pasta"", and tell the maid ""you must use the stove twice a day to cook the family lunch and dinner"", that doesn't at all mean that my wife is contradictory, arbitrary, mad, unfair or shows favouritism. It just means that she gives **different rules to different people because they have different roles and/or different maturity levels.** Of course, someday when Emma grows up, we will give her a different set of rules to follow just as we have given our adult son. Not that we change; she changes. The Bible clearly shows God's **progressive revelation** to mankind as they learned more about Him -- in the early times of Adam, Noah, etc. God dealt with mankind on an **individual** basis. Then at the time of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc. God dealt with **families** (mainly Abraham's seed). Then when they landed in Egypt and were later forced into slavery, God dealt with them as a **nation**, rescuing Israel as a people for Himself. The monarchy and the division of the kingdom follow. Then, as they rejected and crucified Christ as their Messiah, God set aside Israel temporarily and turned to the Gentiles by setting up the **church** (comprising saved Jews and Gentiles, but the vast majority being Gentiles), which is His **worldwide** programme so that the world may know Him. But when the ""fullness of the Gentiles"" is up, God will once again graft in the nation of Israel (Ro. 11:25) and deal with Israel directly.

The Mosaic Law was not a perpetual covenant, but a Suzerain-Vassal covenant.   God called the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt and wanted to set them up as a distinct nation in the Promised Land. For that reason, since Israel was separated as a people unto Him, God gave Israel certain commandments to set her apart and not behave like the evil Canaanites and other nations around them, also so that they would know that they were different -- for their national identity and distinctiveness. That is the Mosaic Law, which includes the Ten Commandments and the numerous other rules that seem petty to us but which served the purpose of setting them apart, including dietary restrictions, what they could or couldn't wear, hygiene (bodily discharges, skin diseases), etc. In Leviticus 18-20 alone, we find it mentioned no fewer than 24 times, ""I am the LORD""/""I am the LORD your God"". The summary statement is in Lev. 20:22-26, ""You shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them: that the land, where I bring you to dwell therein, vomit you not out. **And you shall not walk in the customs of the nation, which I cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and therefore I abhorred them**. But I have said unto you, you shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that flows with milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, who **has separated you from other people. You shall therefore make a distinction between clean animals and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and you shall not make your souls abominable by animal, or by fowl, or by any manner of living thing that creeps on the ground, which I have separated from you as unclean. And you shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have separated you from other people, that you should be mine**."" It is key to understand this, otherwise we end up very muddled (it would be like my maid arguing why Emma my four-year-old needn't touch the stove whereas she has to and why can't she be like Emma?). Israel is given earthly promises and an earthly inheritance. In contrast, the church has a heavenly inheritance (Jn. 8:23; Ro. 12:2; Eph. 1:3, 11, 14, 18; 2:6; Col. 1:12; 3:24; Heb. 3:1; etc.). Thus it would be poor hermeneutics to apply the laws meant for Israel to the church. Sure, we can draw general lessons, but there is no direct application."
isw9mz4,,y7fpb3,"For this, the three aspects of the law are helpful: the principle of the law, the commandments of the law, and the rituals of the law. If we do not differentiate between these three things, it can get messy. 

First, the principle of the law is over. Today, in the dispensation of grace, God does not deal with us according to the principle of the law; rather, He deals with us according to the principle of faith. Whether or not we shall be justified, saved, and accepted by God depends on the principle of faith, not the principle of the law. As long as we have faith in Christ, we are justified by God, accepted by Him, and saved. This is what it means for the principle of the law to be abolished in Christ under the dispensation of grace.  
  
Although the principle of the law has been abolished, the commandments of the law have not been annulled. Instead, the standard of these commandments has been **uplifted**. Thus, the commandments, related to the moral standards, have not been abolished; they will remain for eternity. Even for eternity we should not worship an idol, murder, steal, or lie. In His heavenly kingdom the King has uplifted (Matt 5-7) the standard of the law in two ways: by complementing the lower laws and by changing the lower laws into higher laws. In this way the morality in the commandments of the law has been uplifted to a higher standard.  
  
Jesus Himself kept all the commandments of the law when He was on earth. Then He went to the cross to die for us. Through His substitutionary death, He fulfilled the law on the negative side. Furthermore, through His substitutionary death, He released His resurrection life into us, and we now have this resurrection life in our spirit. Because we are able to live by this resurrection life, we have the strength, ability, and capacity to have the highest standard of morality. As we walk according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4), we fulfill the righteous requirements of the law, fulfilling even more than the law requires. **Therefore, we do not abolish the law; rather, we fulfill it in the highest way.**  
  
The third aspect of the law is the rituals of the law. For example, offering sacrifices and keeping the Sabbath are outward rituals of the law. These rituals were also terminated because they were part of the old dispensation of shadows, figures, and types, all of which have been fulfilled by Christ as the reality. We are no longer obligated to observe the rituals of the law. Therefore, the principle of the law and the rituals of the law have been terminated, but the commandments of the law, which require a high moral standard, have not been terminated. Rather, these commandments have been uplifted. By means of Christ as the resurrection life in our spirit, we can fulfill the standard of morality required by the higher law of the kingdom of the heavens."

iswonko,Animore,y7fpb3,"Thanks for the response, I believe this did help to clarify things in my head a bit.

So I guess my next question would be, if the law still applies and is eternally righteous, should followers of Christ still strive to follow the law? Even if it's impossible for the law to be totally fulfilled except by Christ, he did want everyone to obey the will of the Father and of his commandments right? Or is it all just covered in the ""love god"" and ""love your neighbor"" commands?

My main holdup I guess is why certain parts of the law seem to still apply, e.g. the 10 commandments, while other laws, such as Kosher and other rituals, just don't. And if the law is eternally good and binding, what makes Christians not have to do their best to follow those parts of the law?"

The ""End"" in Romans 10:4 does not mean removal, or destruction, or deletion, or anything like those words.

""End"" there means ""target"", ""final total"", ""objective"", or ""result"".  Words like that.

Torah is a path and that path leads to Jesus.  Jesus is the end of the Law.  He himself said he did not come to abolish, delete, or anything else like that.  He came to live, obey, fulfill.  If you follow him, and the way he lived, you'll be doing Torah and you'll end up with him.

Here's the Greek for the entire verse:

https://biblehub.com/strongs/romans/10-4.htm

Here's that particular word being translated as ""end"" (which is ""telos"") being used in examples throughout scripture:

https://biblehub.com/greek/telos_5056.htm

So to be clear:  Torah is a path given by Yahweh.  Jesus walked that path perfectly.  He obeyed the Father and kept His ways.  If you or I walk that same path, we'll find Jesus at the end of that path.

You've got the idea, but the other component is teaching correct doctrine concerning the law. Jesus was constantly correcting and criticizing the teachers of the day for their doctrinal views.

>But what about the ritualistic parts of the law? I understand that the 10 commandments might still apply, but the law is a unit right? Why can we put down some practices demanded by the law but we're still bound by others?

You're right it is a unit, some parts cannot be followed physically to the letter because there is no physical temple and no priesthood to preside over the ritual. There are two aspects to following the law: the physical and the spiritual. Paul talks about this even though during his time the temple was still standing. He finds that our bodies are a temple because the spirit of God dwells inside us. (1 Cor 6:19) To give an example, Sukkot is one of the fall festivals outlined in Leveticus 23. How much can we follow? In reality the only thing we can't follow is to go to the temple to offer a sacrifice. We can still observe the Sabbaths, still have a feast, still dwell in booths (I go camping!), etc. To spiritualize the sacrificial offering part you can donate food to the homeless, domestic abuse shelters, etc. God has always accepted these good works.

Yes the 10 commandments still apply. Still wrong to lie, murder, steal, and covet, not observe Sabbath, idolitry still wrong, etc. I think of it like this, all the physical requirements about the temple and priesthood are simply on pause at the moment until they return. The reason we are able to apply things spiritually is because our high priest, Jesus, is in heaven at the throne of the most high. Actually, when the physical temple and priesthood returns, that is a prophecy concerning the return of the Messiah when he sets up his government to rule the earth for 1000 years, so it has it's purpose.

Edit: added why we are able to apply the spiritual understanding in the last paragraph."
isxk3e6,nickshattell,y7fpb3,"If I may chime in here, the Scriptures tell us more on this. 

As you can see, the Ten Commandments, or Ten Words were written by the Finger of God (Exodus 31:18, Deuteronomy 9:10), and ""nothing more was added"" (Deuteronomy 5:22). Moses receives these stone tablets, and Israel begins to worship a golden calf as their God before Moses even returns from the Mountain (Exodus 32). The remainder of the Torah was a ""witness against Israel"" (Deuteronomy 31:26) who had been ""rebellious against the Lord since knowing Moses"" (Deuteronomy 9:24).

When Christ comes, He fulfills and confirms the Ten Commandments (as others have mentioned, He was the only one who could perfectly obey, or fulfill them) - see the parable of the rich ruler, etc., He also comes with the finger of God (Luke 11:50). He also fulfills the witness against Israel and Judah (who had profaned the covenant to it's fullness - see Jeremiah and Ezekiel for some clear examples on this). He witnesses against their false understanding and theft of the literal law (which they use to confirm the appearances of their own self-Holiness) - As you can see - Jesus healed lepers (Leviticus 13 and 14), the lame and the blind and the sick (Leviticus 21:18), women with the curse of blood (Leviticus 15), etc.. as the religious leaders and lawmakers saw and defined them as sinners according to appearances only, using the words of the Torah that their ancestors had rejected and profaned.

Other things Jesus teaches also help us better understand the Holy Scriptures. For example, to ""love the neighbor as one self"" is the same spiritual law as ""an eye for an eye"" - because the harm we do to others harms our own spirit - and we must turn this ""eye for an eye"" toward self-examination as Jesus' also teaches - Matthew 5:29, and more. There are many examples, as the Son reveals the Father (Matthew 11:27, Luke 10:22)."
iswrsgd,paul_1149,y7fpb3,"That's a good question. Paul deals with it a bit at Rom 10:

- ""² For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge.
³ For not knowing about God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
⁴ For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. (Rom 10:2-5)

And Hebrews:

- ""¹ For the Law, since it has only a shadow of the good things to come and not the very form of things, can never, by the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year, make perfect those who draw near."" (Heb 10:1)

Read all of Heb 9 and 10.

Once you have the fullness, you don't need the letter. If you understand the dietary laws are about purity, and that they various feasts all point to Christ, they are not necessary anymore. As for the moral law, Paul says that he who loves, fulfills the law.

The difference is one of motivation. The law involves fear of punishment if you don't keep it perfectly. The covenant of spirit is motivated by love. So I can avoid adultery out of fear, or out of love. The first makes me miserable, and doesn't solve my lust problem. The second fills me with love, and love will not permit the lust. 

We have a better covenant in Christ. If you're not perfected in love, then that fear of God, or at least of punishment, 'is a good thing that keeps you in line. But you should strive to be perfected in love, and use the commandments as a guideline to learn the principles behind them."
isujkde,ArchaicChaos,y7fpb3,"Because they didn't want to conform to the new arrangement, quite obviously. Have you not read Acts 15:10? Peter says ""why place them under a law not even we can bear?"" In other words, do *not* put the gentiles under a law we couldn't keep ourselves. Peter goes on to say what the Christians should do and he never says ""you jews, keep that old law.""

Paul's biggest obstacle was to convince the gentiles not to proselytize themselves and come under the old Jewish law, and to convince the Jewish Christians not to stay under the old law. You find this problem talked about in 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Colossians (especially chapter 2), Philippians (especially chapter 3), Ephesians, Galatians, Romans (especially chapters 2-8), you find the Letter to the Hebrews, again, entirely about this issue, you find John showing this symbolically in his gospel, if you can understand him. For example, in John 2 when Jesus turns the water into wine. It wasn't just any water, it was the ceremonial hand washing water of the old Jewish rituals. What they used to cleanse themselves. This is very symbolic. New wine can't be stored in old wineskins. In other words, the old law is being replaced by the new.

Jews were told that the covenant of God would remain forever, they would always be his chosen people, and they always had to follow the law. It was ingrained into their culture, lifestyle, language, etc. The letter to the Hebrews, the audience is said to have undergone persecution for turning from Judaism to Christianity. This includes them being persecuted by the officials, as Christianity was illegal but Judaism was integrated and provisions for them were made. The jews around them would persecute them and shun them. Businesses were hard if you were a jew in Jewish culture and then stopped practicing Judaism. Imagine being a Muslim in a Muslim country and converting to Christianity. This is the same kind of persecution Paul is facing in your passage in Acts. 

They found that Paul was telling people not to follow the old law. He was doing exactly that. We have his writings and they explicitly say it. As I've pointed out. Paul took the Nazarite vow to ""become a jew to the jews... to become all things to people of all sorts so that I might save some."" So as not to offend them, he went under the Jewish law for them. It didn't work, they called him out again and he was persecuted for it as we read. But his undergoing the law didn't show that he was in favour of it. Why would he have been killed for it then? These Jewish Christians had a massively difficult time understanding that this eternal covenant was broken when they killed God's anointed Messiah, and they are only God's people forever if they obey him, which they did not. They didn't understand that their rich culture was now meaningless, and they are not under that law anymore once they have Christ. It isn't that we need to do both. We only need Christ. He is sufficient, is he not?"

it9wa1v,hikaruelio,y7fpb3,"This is where eisegesis will mislead you. The definition you are choosing to go with (while valid for the word) along with your explanation, does not fit the context of the verse, nor does it align with the reality of the gospel. If the ""target, final total, objective, or result"" of doing the law is that you end up with Christ, Israel would not have ""misstepped"", which misstep is the whole point of Romans 9-11. If what you say is true, Israel as a whole, even until this very day, would have received the Christ, rather than rejecting Him. Of course, this has not happened.

The portion that immediately follows the verse in question is this:

*For Moses writes concerning the righteousness which is out of the law: “The man who does them shall live by them.” But the righteousness which is out of faith speaks in this way, Do not say in your heart, “Who will ascend into heaven?” that is, to bring Christ down; Or, “Who will descend into the abyss?” that is, to bring Christ up from the dead.* (10:5-7)

First, ""For"" indicates a continuation; his explanation for the preceding verse is coming. I assume you are familiar with the source of this citation (Deut. 30:11-14). Moses speaks concerning the keeping of the law. But here, Paul substitutes the law with Christ! Why does he do this? Because this is to take the law in the way of righteousness out of faith; it is to believe that the law IS Christ. He is the word, the testimony of God. Right after saying that Christ is the end of the law, he cites verses about the law and replaces the law with Christ. The law has been superseded by Christ.

Note that this is contrasted with verse 5, which is wholly involved with our ""doing"", of which you speak. This is why your interpretation of verse 4, also wholly involved in ""doing"", does not fit."

No. The apostles got it and clearly taught this in the NT epistles, if you know how to read them. I can't make this any more clear. Stop being stubborn and obstinate, trying to fashion after your own views.

>even though they received clear orders from Jesus that the Mosaic law was no longer binding?

They didn't receive clear orders from Jesus that the law wasn't binding. This was revelation by the Spirit after his death. Which is why it took time to understand. Which is why Peter had the vision for example and understood it afterwards. Again... not sure how you're not getting this. It isn't complicated. 

>The resolution of the Jerusalem council seems clear enough (to me, anyway).

Apparently not because you seem to think their resolution was for the Jews to keep holding to the old law. Why in the *world* would the letter to the Hebrews be inspired text if you think this was the result of the council? It's obvious that you have only ever read Acts and haven't a clue what any other NT books are about. Even then, you don't have a firm grasp on Acts.

>James (Jesus' brothers, who presumably knew a thing or two about his teachings)

Who weren't his followers until after his death btw

>tells non-Jews to refrain from a few things, whereas Jews are expected to proceed as usual,

Not sure where you got this

>that is, to live in accordance with the Mosaic law

Not what they said. Again I refer you to Acts 15:10.

>Even Peter, Jesus' chief apostle, is veritably shocked when he erroneously thinks that he's being commanded to eat certain foods in a vision. But if all dietary restrictions had already been abolished by Jesus, what was Peter on about?

Jesus didn't abolish them in his life, which I will give you this one as not your being ignorant of the scripture, but due to some very poor translations in English. There's a phrase which seems to indicate that that Jesus abolished food laws in his ministry but that's not the case. There were abolished in his death.

Peter was being shown this transition of the new and old covenant and the vision is part of how Peter was to learn. I'm very confused as to why you think Jews are under the old law and yet God would give Peter a vision telling him that this law is not in effect? What exactly are you arguing for or are you arguing just to hear yourself speak? If Peter is given a vision in which he is told not to call the clean things unclean, why do you think Peter and James would turn around in the council and say ""ah yes, Jews, these animals God told me not to call unclean... yeah we're still gonna say they're unclean. Carry on as usual."""

For you, you gotta stop shelling up the moment you begin to walk in.

Not sure why your roommate is trying to fight at the close range when you do that, if he was more experienced he could’ve clipped you just stepping back and throwing a lead hook. If you’re gonna try to close the gap, head movement or that jab is your key. You guys both looked gassed tbh and there really wasn’t much happening other than a couple punches here and there so I can say much about that, but you both need a lot more volume. Defensively you guys both have a lot to work on, you got your hands down WAYYY too much. Especially closer to the ropes you’re gonna get punished bad. Your roommate shells up and gets so low that he has no balance that if you throw an uppercut or hook you would’ve landed it without getting countered at all. He also telegraphs the right hand every single time, he jabs then has his right pulled down which is a huge indicator that he’s about to throw but you weren’t punishing him for that, would’ve liked to see you try and catch the jab and throw something over the top.

itbohxm,Jbots,yaepa4,Once the league adopts the 7 foul rule we will be good to go.
itbgl66,Catfish_Mudcat,yaepa4,"It's crazy how young OO is and this was his first regular uninjured off-season.  

His energy off the bench is great and much needed.   He'll get his starting time eventually but for right now he's good in his role with his minutes."
itbj1qe,Unlucky-Sir322,yaepa4,"2-0, and we already got folks trying to fix the team."
itbxxs3,jtezus,yaepa4,OO would definitely get more minutes if he learns how to not foul as much as he does. People also acting like CC hasn’t been playing well which just isn’t true his defense has been great.
itbz7eb,nikiverse,yaepa4,"I do love OO’s style of play out there, he got that swag"
itea07e,Ghostlucho29,yaepa4,It’s two goddamn games wtf
itc0ifw,Shade_Raven,yaepa4,He's gotta stop fouling but he'll get his minutes
itce72r,SirJoeffer,yaepa4,Once you get a player at around 16-18 minutes then per36 starts to project performance very well. The problem is people using it for guys playing <5 minutes lol
itar6h6,user-234522467898,yaepa4,All just stupid fouls too like over the back and shit like that really frustrating. I think alot of that comes with experience hes still very young and really only has a season and a half of playing time under his belt
itas8mq,user-234522467898,yaepa4,"Ik its a two game sample size but his efficiency in both these games and last year is crazy, clint def fits the starting lineup as far as what they need from a 5 rn, just saying by the end of this season(if he can stop getting stupid fouls) he should probs be both finishing games and having more minutes than clint"
itbibid,anonaliasass,yaepa4,these stats are only from game 1
itevws8,MA73N,yaepa4,6.9….. nice
itbovin,General-Yak5264,yaepa4,Why dafuq you underestimating OO? He can get more fouls!
itc3y1s,user-234522467898,yaepa4,I think his role is good but i think he could use some more minutes
itc0k7w,Shade_Raven,yaepa4,Play AJG
itc1exf,user-234522467898,yaepa4,Would it be a hox subreddit without that
itcmzn9,user-234522467898,yaepa4,"Lmao ikr, doesnt help its only a 2 game sample size but its fun to get excited ab this kind of stuff imo"
itea1o6,Ghostlucho29,yaepa4,It actually does help. Don’t worry about this
itan5lw,KellenLy12,yaddol,"He’s a good player. Who wants to play here. And has a good attitude. People with that combination don’t grow on trees, can we please stop trying to trade him."
itanlg8,AlexAnthopoulos_irl,yaddol,Throw in DeAndre and call it a Fearsome Four
itaxhsa,Nxrway,yaddol,Yeah I do not know why people were so ready to drop him

itckoit,EmoSchnauzer,yaddol,People forget the report that Collins and the team mutually agreed to seek out trade options. Unless I’m forgetting that being debunked. Thankfully a good deal never materialized.
itan8ek,user-234522467898,yaddol,Completely agree. I honestly think the majority of the rumors we hear are the front office just testing value not as serious as the media makes it out to be.

isu0gqp,3gregor_s,y79bl7,"Literally the verse says, ""Am I concealing..."" (המכסה אני - hamechase Ani), and I'd construe it as a rhetorical question rather than an instance of divine uncertainty. Also, since this doesn't strike me as an exclusively Christian forum, I'll share with you a Jewish concept that might make such questions less perplexing. Traditional Jewish commentators say of certain things that דיברה תורה כלשון בני אדם - The Torah spoke in the language of men. For example, in Genesis 6:6 we read, ""and God regretted..."" But surely, for various reasons, God cannot regret! So what's going on here? The answer is that the Torah spoke in the language of men. The intended reader is a human being, so certain things have to be conveyed a certain way (how else would we get so much as an inkling of what was going on?), even if they don't reflect absolute philosophical or metaphysical truths."
ist9dt2,ironicalusername,y79bl7,"God is sometimes presented as more humanlike in some of the older stories.  Sure, by our modern view of God, God wouldn't need to think things over- he would instantly know whatever he needed to know.

You can see other examples of this, too- sometimes God is presented as having a body that could be mistaken for human.  He even famously wrestles with Jacob.   This sounds very odd to us now with our view of God as a spiritual being, but not every author always saw God the way we see him now."
ist66xx,user-234522467898,y79bl7,"Also for anyone unfamiliar with those chapters, theres a great reference of the trinity when God appears to Abraham as three separate men. Just thought that was cool. Genesis 18."
iswiclc,TheOleCurmudgeon,y79bl7,"God asks many questions in the Bible. All are rhetorical of course, He already knows the answers. But He asks as a conversation starter. There’s a term for opening communication with a question but I don’t remember what it is. God blessed Hagar and Ishmael and made many descendants because of His covenant with Abram to greatly increase and bless abrams descendents. Just because abram and Sarah tried to mess that up with hagar, God is of course bound to His promise, and thus we have the troubled relationships today. Not Gods fault, blame Sarah."
istdr6d,Yesmar2020,y79bl7,"Yeah, those “omni-“ descriptions people apply to God really skew his revelation of who and what God is."
isu7713,-Santa-Clara-,y79bl7,">*When God is talking to Abraham about destroying Sodom, he says before in my translation “Should I tell Abraham”, this is probably the first time I’ve seen an example of God basically mulling something over or “thinking” but because he is omnipresent I always assumed he wouldn’t think he would just know.* 

You will not make many friends for you with the subject matter of this passage, neither among US‑Americans & their poor victims, nor the Talmud Jews & Muslims worldwide ... but I recommend that you first translate this passage from an unadulterated Hebrew original, because all English ""translations"" are wrong and additionally the Jews had exchanged in verse 22 Abraham with LORD, i.e. not Abraham stood before the Lord, but the Lord stood before Abraham, for the Torah didn't fit the Jewish claim that the rest of mankind should bless themselves in Noah and not in Abraham. 

&#x200B;

PS   It's not a consideration by the Lord, but a question for the reader who reflects on what has been read, and to draw attention to Abraham walking before the Lord as opposed to Noah, who walked only with the Lord and who didn't care about drowning neighbors according to God's Torah."
isu907u,hikaruelio,y79bl7,"Chapter 18 of Genesis is a great picture of how God chooses to operate in many situations (even today). In spite of his omnipotence and omniscience, He still chooses to limit Himself to man's cooperation. During this intercession, both God and Abraham were only concerned for saving Lot and his family, and it seemed both knew what was on the other's mind, yet neither mentioned it outright. This is a great principle we ought to all learn, to have God's mind regarding the things related to us and the things in the world, and to intercede according to God's will.

A similar thing happened with Hannah, before she bore Samuel, who was uniquely instrumental to God's administration during his time. It wasn't until Hannah prayed according to what was on God's heart concerning her situation that God came in and did something both for Himself, and for her.

There are 2 great messages that get into this matter in Genesis 18, available here (messages 51 and 52 of the Life Study of Genesis) https://www.ministrybooks.org/books/?t=LS

Regarding Ishmael, the verse says that God blessed him because he was still Abraham's seed (21:13). Why intrinsically? I am not completely sure. We know from Galatians 3 that in typology Hagar and Sarah represent the law and grace, respectively. We also know that God has allowed the flesh (corresponding to the law) to remain with us as long as we are here on this earth, according to His wisdom. Although it causes a problem, it definitely still serves its purpose, which we may or may not know from our own experience. These negative things do tend to drive us to seek God in a more desperate way, as this may have also been the case with Israel."
isvfuff,Relevant-Ranger-7849,y79bl7,"even though Israel were God's chosen, He still blessed others outside of the children of Israel. it is just that Israel was to be His vehicle to spread the good news and Word about Him. this is also why He allowed non israelites to be apart of Israel. these were called proselytes. A proselyte is a new convert, especially someone who has recently switched from one religion to another."
isvx5tf,Cremasterau,y79bl7,"The whole biblical narrative is about the developing relationship between God and his chosen people.

It is rightly described as a marriage and consideration of what the other partner thinks is part of that relationship.

A similar situation occurs in Job where Job directly challenges the actions of God. And ultimately God respects and even encourages it.

The deepening understanding of the other is another reason why the Bible is so riveting."
isy15dn,incomprehensibilitys,y79bl7,"Why is it  a problem for God to be omniscient omnipotent omnipresent, and also to wrangle with himself about how he will do things?

If you totally love your SO, then why do you need to keep telling them and keep thinking about it in your head?

If you completely understand a problem and have made a decision, but you think about it later does that mean that you didn't know what you were doing?

Jesus was omniscient, he knew people's thoughts. So why did he need to weep? Why did he need to have a conversation in the garden with the Father asking that if the cup of suffering would pass from Him? And many other things

why did God need to create a race of homo sapiens, minuscule ephemeral dust specks on a minor planet. Wasn't The Fellowship of the three persons enough?

God in three Persons. He is not an automaton"
istp9oi,user-234522467898,y79bl7,"Thank you this really clarified it, any clue about the other question?"
ist94r4,ironicalusername,y79bl7,"These men are explicitly referred to as angels, later on.  So I think it would be a mistake to think they were Jesus and the HS instead- those two persons are God itself,  not angels, according to Christian theology."
istph4z,user-234522467898,y79bl7,"exactly its very confusing when people make God seem like almost a myth, but thats why I think the Old Testamentis great because you can see God interacting with people face to face."
isytt2o,user-234522467898,y79bl7,"That is true, I was just confused bc it almost seemed like he was thinking, but other people clarified it for me, thank you so much!"
istp5m2,user-234522467898,y79bl7,"Ohhhh ok thank you for clarifying, I’m doing a finish the Bible in 365 thing so I only go through 16-18 today. Does it mention that in this chapter and I just overlooked it?"
istqxqr,Yesmar2020,y79bl7,"True, I find it very enlightening, but keep in mind, he’s meeting them face to face as they, an ancient Near Eastern warrior culture, expect him to be, not as he truly is."
isz0d3s,incomprehensibilitys,y79bl7,"Right

also, why would he need to be a jealous God if he knew exactly all the decisions that all people would make at every point in the future?

Jesus knew people's thoughts who were around Him
  It didn't necessarily mean he knew.every single choice they would make for breakfast lunch and dinner for the rest of their lives. There is an aspect of human free will that is not predictable.

For  not to the world but to his people, he urges them to choose life and to do good and to follow Him picking up their cross daily

If we were robots, why would they need to say that so often?

He is all knowing  but there is still an element of human  and I don't think that is part of being all-knowing.

There is a general all-knowing such as he makes it rain on the just and unjust and unlikely  knowing about whether you choose to brush the left side of your long hair 98 or 99 times tomorrow."
istpsne,ironicalusername,y79bl7,"I don't think you overlooked it, you just didn't read that far yet.    At the end of Gen 18, the two ""men"" are going toward Sodom.  In Gen 19, right at the beginning, we have this:

>>The two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting in the gateway of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he rose to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground.

It's a continuation of the same narrative but now suddenly they are called angels instead of men."
istrcm6,user-234522467898,y79bl7,Ohhhh that clarifies it even more. Thank you so much for your comment!
istrlkb,user-234522467898,y79bl7,"Oh ok got it, looking forward to getting to that excerpt."
