ybk1oa,Christian,How should we be around lukewarm Christians?,/r/Christian/comments/ybk1oa/how_should_we_be_around_lukewarm_christians/,2022-10-23 08:06:43,immortal_avenger,"Y'all, I'm struggling here.

I've been following Christ for the past few years, running in earnest with the Holy Spirit to reveal things within me that have not been nailed to the cross. I'm not perfect at this, I still rebel more often than I'd like to admit, but I take comfort in the grace He's offered to me. 

My struggle is with my fellow Christians and having people to actually support me in this. I have been to several churches in different denominations and this seems to be a common occurrence. 

Nobody seems as serious about this life as scripture mandates. 

It breaks my heart to write this, these are nice people and I love them so, but spiritually I am starving to death here. I'm a massive people person and with these people keeping one foot in the world and one foot in the church, it's so hard for me not to align with their world view, despite how empty I feel inside after hanging out with them. 

Many have called me extreme, that I'm taking things too far. Yet, the more I read and pray and seek the Lord, I feel as if I'm barely doing the bare minimum to bring Him glory. Like the extreme is simply *the standard*. 

To list one thing that has changed within me since I started down this path, I no longer watch as many movies or TV shows as I used to. Not just because of some ungodly content, but because sitting in front of the TV or phone in a sedentary state just doesn't bring glory to God. Period. He put me on this earth to do His work and I'm not gonna do that very well if I'm putting junk inside. Even educational material like some of the YouTubers I watch is next to useless if I'm not growing in my knowledge of Him or serving Him in other ways. I could go into further detail, but that's not the point of this post. This is just one of many things that my friends don't see as necessary. 

And wow, oh how  I *hate* when they simply say ""well, everyone worships God in different ways."" It's dismissive, like they won't even consider their ways and that the way they're living may be separating them from God. Even if their lifestyles don't seem to be inherently sinful, that doesnt automatically mean they're glorifying God. 

I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS. Everyone is so conflict averse, they don't want to talk about right and wrong because they don't wanna offend anybody and ""push them away from Jesus."" Jesus presented right and wrong (lovingly, as we ought to imitate) and let people decide for themselves. Sometimes they walked away. Why are we so afraid of that when He wasn't? 

*sigh* 

NOBODY IS ALL IN. 

NOBODY WANTS TO CHASE AFTER GOD LIKE THE HOUSE IS ON FIRE. *ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THAT BIBLICALLY IT IS* 

Nobody wants to love God, they just want to be loved by Him. 

Nobody wants to fear God, which is the beginning of knowledge. 

They want to have the world and their Jesus too. But not the real Jesus, just their idea of him. 

I'm so frustrated. 


I want to confront my friends, but I know it would be pearls before swine. These people are set in their ways, in love with this world. 

I know the road is narrow, but I was hoping I'd at least have somebody's shoulder to tap. I feel so alone in this. 

I just got done hanging out with some of these friends these past few nights and we were simply playing games and watching movies. I tried to have fun, I even brought a few that I particularly enjoy and they seemed to like it. I love these people, I love to make them laugh and just simply be with them. Humor is one of the ways I try to relate to them, but I wasn't put here to be the funny guy. At best, it's merely a tool in my box to help spread the Good News. 

But when I'm with them I'm just doing it for my pleasure and their entertainment. I'm not fulfilling my true purpose because I'm so focused on not losing them. 
And in doing so, I'm literally doing the same thing that I've just said they're doing. I'm compromising my convictions for the sake of community. This cannot go on.



None of them really seem to want to be with God. 

They won't love the people He calls us to love, instead only loving those who are easy to love. 

None of them want their world to revolve around Him. 

I want God. I want to be with Him. 

But oh God, I'm so afraid to be alone. 

I love people, I need people. I need brothers and sisters who can come alongside me and help me up. 

I have one best friend who is just as on fire as I am, if not more, but he lives halfway across the country. I attend a men's prayer breakfast on Wednesday mornings, and I've cultivated some wonderful relationships there, but I've yet to find any spiritually fulfilling ones. I also attend a Bible study on Tuesday mornings with a different church, and some of those men are filled with the spirit. But the age gap is large and nobody seeks to mentor. I don't know what to do.


I feel the need to depart from most of my current friends, these lukewarm Christians. But I'm so afraid. Not just because of losing them, but because I'm afraid I might be wrong. What if I am going too far? What if I'd be jumping the gun? What if in doing so I forsake His greatest commandment to love one another? How will it reflect upon me and my faith if I walk away from these people in the name of God? 

I'm so afraid to lose my churchgoing friends but I'm even more afraid to conform to the world, which I fear they will unwittingly lead me to do. We're covered by grace, assuredly, but do we go on sinning so that grace may abound?



I should mention the passage in the NT regarding eating clean/unclean food, observing some days as Holy while others don't, etc because I know somebody will bring it up. I've looked at this, and I agree. Not everybody will have the same convictions as me. My problem is that *NOBODY SEEMS TO HAVE ANY CONVICTIONS.* Everybody just seems to have the mindset of ""how much of the world can I have and still be ok with Jesus?"" instead of ""what can I do to please and glorify Him?""


I just want to go to Heaven and join the rest of His Bride. I'm just so tired. 


Am I doing anything wrong here? Is my perspective as Biblical as I believe it is? I'm willing to be wrong here, in fact I'd like to be as long as it's Biblically sound. It's just that at every turn I seem to be brought to the same conclusion, and it's such a terrifying choice. 

If you have perspective and advice, I'd love to hear it. If you don't, I'd appreciate your prayer just as much",True

Personally, my main reason is Mathematics - Prof Peter Stoner, a famous professor & mathematician, used maths to argue Jesus was the Messiah, for instance: The probability of one individual fulfilling a mere eight of the hundreds of Messianic prophecies of the OT was equivalent to a blind man finding a particular item in the state of Texas, after the entire state was covered in them.

ybrlf7,Christian,Thoughts on MBTI?,/r/Christian/comments/ybrlf7/thoughts_on_mbti/,2022-10-23 13:08:20,PastelChristian,"So I used to be SUPERR obsessed with Mbti. Like, I would spend *hours* everyday just trying to figure out my personality type (I got Infj/Infp)

After a while of studying personality types, I realized that they sounded kind of similar to zodiac signs.

Zodiac signs stereotype your personality based on your birthday. And these stereotypes are typically half good + half bad. For example:

Cancer: 

Good Traits: Empathetic, Loyal, and Committed.
Bad Traits: Sensitive, Vindictive, and Jealous. (Who wants to be vindictive?? 🤨)

Not to mention that you probablyyy shouldn’t be calling yourself a cancer. (Proverbs 18:21)

That’s what I noticed about Personality Types as well. Sure, Infjs can be Advocative, Supportive, Altruistic, but they’re also categorized as Stubborn, People-Pleasers, Perfectionists, etc.. 

 I started to identify with all those titles, and it took such a negative toll on my mind. It was so often that I would feel overwhelmed, lonely, and depressed.

I realized, I didn’t want people to look at me and see a Perfectionist or a People-Pleaser. I want to be looked at like *Jesus.* I am made in *His* Image. So eventually I had to stop identifying with all that personality stuff.

So I don’t think Personality Types should really be messed with. Your thoughts?",True

That’s just not true! Mormons believe Jesus was born on another planet. He came because he needed a body. 

Jenkins can't believe that.

She said she had to break up with me. I was distraught and for an hour I tried to explain myself.

It attacks my religion and it makes it very hard to be a Christian at times. It causes me so much stress I don’t know what to do. I truly love god and accept Jesus as my lord and my savior, yet I look at things out of fear of going to hell and always am worried if I’m sinning or not.

For some backstory, I had bad anxiety about death in November of 2020. It went away after a couple days, but came back badly in late December 2020. I decided to accept Jesus as my lord and my savior around that time and I had a fire for Jesus for a long time. Until some point in fall of 2021 I stopped reading the Bible and fell back into sin and would pray and try to stop but I would sin again and again. Thankfully I never gave up and continued believing and finally got my act together and I have been reading the Bible 30 mins a day and praying more often. Sometimes I pray multiple times a day!!! But when I read the Bible it triggers my ocd or even when I see anything about religion or death.

My intrusive thoughts try to get me to leave the religion and say awful things. So naturally I fight the thoughts. But then that actually causes ppl with ocd to panic and then have a panic attack. Fighting the thoughts is actually worse for you.

I’m not perfect, only God is perfect. God is so perfect that when he was in a human body Jesus was still PERFECT. 

Any advice on how to not listen to my intrusive thoughts? Because it’s getting to the point I have trouble reading the Bible. Religion should bring me joy not pain. So any advice on to ignore my thoughts? Because when I ignore them I worry if I left the faith and I worry if I just do all this out of fear etc… How as a Christian can I look at these thoughts and know they aren’t true and remember that Jesus is the truth.
