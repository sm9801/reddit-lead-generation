sszk5y,Bible,I see the same questions asked every week. Here's a list of tools & resources for you.,/r/Bible/comments/sszk5y/i_see_the_same_questions_asked_every_week_heres_a/,2022-02-15 01:59:26,Jeremehthejelly,"*Which translation should I use? What does this passage mean? Is this verse for me? I need help with interpreting \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_! Was the flood real? Who wrote this?*

Do the above sound familiar to you? It does to me. I'm very happy to see that there's a hunger for understanding the Bible, and it goes to show that the one unified story that leads to Jesus is still powerful, compelling, and full of wonder in 2022.

Someone's gotta compile a list of resources that all Bible seekers and lovers should consider, and I'm gonna attempt it in this post.

Let's start by understanding that there are typically 2 types of Biblical study materials: presuppositional and historical-critical. Presuppositional in simplest terms is any material that presupposes that God does exist and most likely came from a Christian scholar, while historical-critical engages Scripture as they would with any other ancient text, and these scholars may come from non-Christian or even atheistic perspectives. Both are valuable. At the highest level, both are rigorously academic. Both overlap but doesn't always agree on everything. As end consumers, it's best for us consider both. Are you a Christian? Totally fine to own more presupp resources. Skeptic or curious nonbeliever? Historical-critical has lots to offer. I must stress again, it's good to have both resources at hand. Any scholar who treats the Scriptures respectfully is worth your time. Whichever you choose, there are plenty of trustworthy resources within that camp.

&#x200B;

**1. Which Bible translation should I use?**  
TLDR: The one you can understand and will read consistently. Use a few for better comprehension.

Most Bible translations fall somewhere within the word-for-word and thought-for-thought spectrum (unless you picked a super fringe translation as a beginner, which you shouldn't). Pick a few across said spectrum. Don't just use one lest you form a theology solely based on 1 English translation. Use one that was translated by a committee rather than a single author. Another reason to use multiple translations is to more effectively trace themes that occur throughout the Bible. Eg. some translations of Galatians 3:16 says ""seed"" rather than ""offspring"" or ""descendants"". ""Seed"" is a very loaded theological word; depending on the consistency of the translation, this subtle change of wording could cause you to miss a dot in the running theme of Abraham's seed.

W-f-W translations are great for slow, methodological studies, while T-f-T gets the point across during quick casual reading or when a W-f-W translation stumps you. One is not necessarily better than the other; the same scholars could be behind several translations!

Great translations, listed from most W-f-W to most T-f-T:INTERLINEAR, NASB, LSB, LEB, ESV, NRSV, NET, BSB, CSB, NIV, NLT, GNT, EASY

**Elephant in the room: Why is ESV so popular?**  
ESV is pretty much the product of the Young, Restless and Reformed movement in the early 2000s and they are mostly reformed evangelicals. For all its controversy, YRR have a lot of living and active scholars, and they marketed ESV as the translation for churches that take expository preaching seriously. For the most part, it *is* a trustworthy and faithful translation. The ESV appeals to a broad spectrum of clergy and laypeople. There are other great translations out there, but just as how the NIV was on the pews of most churches in the 90s, the ESV is the dominant one today.

Not gonna debate KJV-onlyism here. If you only use that, more power to you. You're entitled to your own opinion.

&#x200B;

**2. Should I get a Study Bible?**  
TLDR: YES!

A study Bible is really more like a mini library. Good study bibles have typically have the Scriptures, basic commentary, historical data, maps, notes on authorship, translation notes, a concordance, reading plans, and a bunch of useful essays to whet your appetite. I'd argue that folks who are new to the Bible should start with a study bible.

When I was a new believer and asked about Study Bibles, I was told to stay away from the notes and only read the text ""because the Holy Spirit will guide you"". That's an oversimplified, hyperspiritualized way of thinking about how the Holy Spirit works. If you need help, you need help; just get a Study Bible because the Holy Spirit can speak through commentaries, just as how the Holy Spirit has guided the process of making the Bible and spoke to the Church through great theologians for the past 2000 years.

Some Study Bibles to consider: ESV Study Bible, New Oxford Annotated Bible, NET Full Notes Bible, NLT Filament Bible, NIV Study Bible

&#x200B;

3**. What does \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ mean? Use Commentaries.**  
**TLDR: PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF SCRIPTURE AND GOOD THEOLOGY, USE COMMENTARIES.**

This is related to point no. 2: if you need help, you need help! Use commentaries. Scripture cannot be interpreted in a vacuum. Bible scholars and theologians from the past and present have spent their entire lifetime peering into the Scriptures trying to interpret them as how the authors meant them, so please please please consider what they have to say. If you have a particular view on what a passage means and it doesn't line up with any of the commentaries available, you might have to correct your view.

Some Bible commentaries to consider, arranged from most accessible to most academic (there are other book-by-book commentaries that are even better, but these are good ones to start with):

1. NT Wright's New Testament For Everyone series
2. NIV Application Commentary
3. [EnduringWord.com/bible-commentary](https://EnduringWord.com/bible-commentary)
4. New Bible Commentary by D.A. Carson
5. The Tyndale series (TOTC & TNTC)

Bonus: [https://catenabible.com/](https://catenabible.com/) is an online compendium of commentaries made by the early church fathers and medieval theologians on the Bible.

&#x200B;

**4. What is the Christian consensus on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_?**  
TLDR: We unite under the Creeds (Apostles', Nicene, Athanasian, Chalcedonian). Everything else depends on which denomination you belong to.

The Creeds lay out the core doctrines of Christianity that we must uphold in order to be considered a Christian (eg. deity status of Jesus, the Godheads/Trinity, Holy Spirit, second coming, etc). When in doubt, always refer to the Creeds and what the early church fathers have to say about the topics you have in mind. Anything that doesn't line up with these 2 could be wrong; new isn't always better in theology.

You can easily google one of the Creeds and read them online. Some churches still run their new believers' course based on the Creeds, typically the Nicene Creed.

&#x200B;

**5. Who/what is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, what is the significance of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, when did \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ take place?**TLDR: Get a Bible Dictionary/Encyclopedia.

A Bible Dictionary is really more like an encyclopedia than a dictionary. You'll find definitions, proper names for word searches, verse references, and other useful information to help you understand the context of what you're reading. If I can only have one tool next to my Bible, I would choose this.

Bible Dictionary/Encyclopedias to consider: Lexham Bible Dictionary, Baker Encyclopedia of The Bible, Holman Illustrated Bible Dictionary, [Catholic Encyclopedia](https://www.newadvent.org/cathen/)

&#x200B;

**7. Can I access all these resources online?**  
TLDR: Absolutely. Use a Bible software.

The gold standard softwares for seminarians, theologians and Bible scholars are Logos Bible Software and Accordance. Each have their own pros and cons and their websites will do a better job of explaining them, so look them up and see which one compels you more. Personally, Logos suits my needs. Even the free version has plenty to offer.

&#x200B;

Other helpful resources:

**BibleProject**  
You should've heard of BibleProject by now and if you haven't, I highly encourage you to start using their materials. As exaggerated as it sounds, BibleProject made the Bible accessible to me and I am forever grateful for the work they've done. They've recently launcehd their own app featuring a highly guided walkthrough of the Pentateuch, among other useful things. If you want something deeper, they also offer graduate-level Bible classes at [Classroom Beta](https://bibleproject.com/classroom).

**Audit seminary courses**  
If you want seminary-level classes without the homework and commitment, this is a great option to consider.My recommendations: [TheosU.ca](https://TheosU.ca) (as low as $20 monthly), [BiblicalTraining.org](https://BiblicalTraining.org) (free), [Thirdmill.org](https://Thirdmill.org) (free), [Seminary Now](https://seminarynow.com/) ($19.99 monthly)

**Books**  
Here's a mixed list of books covering all the areas I could think of that you might have questions about:

1. Simply Christian and Simply Good News by NT Wright
2. How To Read The Bible For All Its Worth by Gordon Fee & Douglas Stuart
3. The Unseen Realm by Michael Heiser
4. The New Testament In Its World by NT Wright & Michael Bird
5. Church History in Plain Language by Bruce Shelley
6. The Great Theologians by Gerald McDermott
7. Hearing God by Nathan Finochio

Online resources: [GotQuestions.org](https://GotQuestions.org) (mostly Reformed but reliable), [Mike Winger's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7u2HaYBKDaLPcWmldxgGEA), the [Ask NT Wright Anything podcast](https://www.premierchristianradio.com/Shows/Weekday/Ask-NT-Wright-Anything), /r/AskBibleScholars, /r/AcademicBiblical,

This certainly isn't an exhaustive list, and I sure hope it isn't exhausting either. May God help you in your journey to read the Scriptures, and may He grant you wisdom and knowledge to choose the right resources. Soli Deo Gloria.

I have a dear friend who is an elder of many years who studies the Hebrew and Greek on a regular basis. 

He made mention of 2 Timothy 2:14 where: Adam not being deceived but Eve being deceived, (THEY) fell into transgression. 

Many times we (Christian men) like to put it all on the women Eve being at fault for original sin… however while we (my friend and I) discussed this and several other verses, we came to the overwhelming conclusion that in fact Adam was far more wicked than Eve in HIS introduction of sin (because sin, stemming from Adam’s heart, being fully formed gives birth to DEATH).

My question is, what is 2 Tim 2:14 saying grammatically in the Greek:

Option 1
1) Adam wasn’t deceived
2) Eve was deceived
3) Points 1 and 2 with regards to the fact EVE (and only Eve) fell into transgression

Option 2
1) Adam wasn’t deceived
2) Eve was deceived

Are there printings that have those types of citations? If not, do you think it’s important to have the exact context, or do you think the NT writers have all the context we’d need?

y7ff52,Bible,Bible Study on the Names of God in the Bible,/r/Bible/comments/y7ff52/bible_study_on_the_names_of_god_in_the_bible/,2022-10-18 11:52:21,christianmolk,"My Bible Study on the names of God in the Bible:

[https://christianmolk.com/2022/10/what-are-the-names-of-god-in-the-bible/](https://christianmolk.com/2022/10/what-are-the-names-of-god-in-the-bible/)

By far the most common name for God in the Bible is ”YHWH” (יהוה) (pronounced “Yahweh”). The name occurs about 6000 times and is usually translated as “Lord” or “LORD” in English translations of the Bible. In the New Testament, YHWH corresponds to the Greek word “Kyrios” (κύριος), which is translated as “Lord”.

The second most common name for God in the Bible is the Hebrew ”Elohim” (אֱלֹהִים), which in the New Testament corresponds to the Greek “Theos” (θεός), and which is translated “God”.

Yahweh/Kyrios and Elohim/Theos are by far the most common names for God in the Bible, and are sometimes used in combination, such as Yahweh Elohim or Kyrios Theos.

In biblical times, a name was more than just an address, it also said something about the character and personality of the person. When someone in the Bible is involved in something significant, it is not uncommon for the person in question to be given a new name, such as Jacob in connection with his wrestling with God:

>“*And he said to him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.”* *Then he said, “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed.”* *Then Jacob asked him, “Please tell me your name.” But he said, “Why is it that you ask my name?” And there he blessed him.*”  
**(**[**Ge 32:27–29**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2032.27%E2%80%9329)**)**

So for anyone who wants to get to know God, his character and personality, the Bible study of his name can be a very good start.

## El, Elohim, Eloah and Theos – God

“El” simply means “God” or “god” and is used in the Bible to refer to both God and idols. It is also not uncommon for God to be called “El” + an attribute, such as “Elyon”, (= the Most High).

>“*In the beginning, God \[Elohim\] created the heavens and the earth.*”  
**(**[**Ge 1:1**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%201.1)**)**

“Elohim” is the plural form of “El” and thus means “gods”, but in Hebrew the plural form is also used to strengthen a word and in that sense Elohim is used as a proper name of God and is then translated as “God”.

>“*Then he said, “I am God \[El\], the God \[Elohim\] of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make you into a great nation.* *I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also bring you up again, and Joseph’s hand shall close your eyes.”*”  
**(**[**Ge 46:3–4**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2046.3%E2%80%934)**)**

“Eloah” is the singular of the plural form Elohim and is translated “God”. The fact that God is described in both singular and plural in the same word in the OT is a picture of the Trinity.

>“*But you are a God \[Eloah\] ready to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love, and did not forsake them.*”  
**(**[**Ne 9:17b**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Neh%209.17b)**)**

## El Elyon, Hypsistos – God Most High

In biblical times, each country or people had its own local gods. To make it clear that God is not just any local mini-god, but he is the One and the Most High, God is sometimes called El Elyon (אֵל עֶלְיוֹן), God the Most High.

>“*And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine. (He was priest of God Most High \[El Elyon\].)”*  
**(**[**Ge 14:18**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2014.18)**)**

# Elohim Yisrael – God of Israel

Not only is God not just any god, but he is also the God of *Israel*. God is the God of the whole world, but he has chosen to reveal himself to Israel, the people he has chosen. So to distinguish God from the idols of other peoples, who were also called “El”, it is not uncommon for God to be described in the Bible as “Elohim Yisrael” (אֱלָהּ יִשְׂרָאֵל), the God of Israel, alternatively the God of the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob:

>“*He said, “Then put away the foreign gods that are among you, and incline your heart to the Lord, the God of Israel \[Elohim Yisrael\].”*”  
**(**[**Jos 24:23**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Josh%2024.23)**)**  
>  
>“*And he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God.*”  
**(**[**Ex 3:6**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%203.6)**)**

God is often referred to as the God of Israel in the context of God’s desire for Israel to be a holy people, distinct from the idolatrous peoples around them. God is not like the other gods.

The mention of God as the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob often refers to the covenant God made with Abraham, of which Israel is a part ([Genesis 12:1-3](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2012.1-3)). God is not just any God, but the God who made a covenant with Abraham and chose Israel as his people.

# El Shaddai, Pantokrator – God Almighty

One of the names of God that stands out in the Old Testament is “El Shaddai” (אֵל שַׁדַּי). The original meaning of the word “shaddai” is unclear, but is often translated as “almighty” and is the name God uses about himself when he reveals himself to Abraham:

>“*When Abram was ninety-nine years old the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am God Almighty \[El Shaddai\]; walk before me, and be blameless,*”   
**(**[**Ge 17:1**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2017.1)**)**

The name El Shaddai is often used in connection with God’s promise to Abraham of miraculous blessings, i.e. the point of the name is that nothing is impossible for God, he can do whatever he wants:

>“*God Almighty \[El Shaddai\]* *bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, that you may become a company of peoples.*”  
**(**[**Ge 28:3**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2028.3)**)**

The very meaning of God’s name El Shaddai recurs in the New Testament as well, for example when Jesus speaks of salvation and Peter thinks that no one can be saved:

>“*But Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”*”  
**(**[**Mt 19:26**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%2019.26)**)**

As impossible as it was for Abraham to have a son at the age of 100, it is just as impossible for a human being to be saved. But because God is “El Shaddai”, the Almighty, God can give Abraham an offspring and he can give birth to us again.

In the New Testament, the Greek equivalent “Pantokrator” (παντοκράτωρ) is also used to describe the miraculous participation of God’s people in Abraham’s covenant and to describe the enormity of God’s greatness:

>“*What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, “I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.* *Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; then I will welcome you,* *and I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty \[Pantokrator\].”*”  
**(**[**2 Co 6:16–18**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Cor%206.16%E2%80%9318)**)**

# Yahweh, Adonijah and Kyrios – The Lord

When the people of Israel are enslaved in Egypt, God appears to Moses at Mount Sinai and commissions him to lead Israel out of slavery. If God had previously made himself known to his people as “Elohim” and to the patriarchs as “El Shaddai”, it was now time for Israel to come to know God by his name “Yahweh”:

>“*God spoke to Moses and said to him, “I am the Lord \[YHWH\].* *I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty \[El Shaddai\], but by my name the Lord \[YHWH\] I did not make myself known to them.*”  
**(**[**Ex 6:2–3**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%206.2%E2%80%933)**)**

However, it should be added that God’s name “Yahweh” as such was known to some even before God revealed it to Moses, but the very *meaning* and *significance* of God’s name Yahweh was first revealed to Israel through Moses. For example, [Genesis 4:26](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%204.26) states that at the time of the life of Adam’s son Seth *“people began to call upon the name of the LORD \[YHWH\]”*. Even Abraham must have known God’s name Yahweh because he calls the place where he did not sacrifice Isaac “Yahweh Yir’eh” ([Genesis 22:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%2022.14)), which means “Yahweh provides”, a name which, incidentally, may be the basis for the name “Jerusalem”.

But when God reveals himself to Moses and wants to send him to Pharaoh, Moses hesitates in the face of the mission and asks for God’s name, not because he necessarily wants to know God’s name but because he wants to understand who God is:

>“*But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?”* *He said, “But I will be with you, and this shall be the sign for you, that I have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.”* *Then Moses said to God, “If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ what shall I say to them?”* *God said to Moses, “I am who I am.” And he said, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘I am has sent me to you.’ ”* *God also said to Moses, “Say this to the people of Israel: ‘The Lord \[YHWH\], the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, and thus I am to be remembered throughout all generations.*”  
**(**[**Ex 3:11–15**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%203.11%E2%80%9315)**)**

The name “I Am Who I Am” expresses God’s character as eternal, absolute and unchanging. God is the one who “is”. He has always existed, is not dependent on anyone and without him there is nothing. God is the one who is the truest of all that is true and the most eternal of all that is eternal.

In the New Testament, this is expressed above all in the Book of Revelation:

>“*“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God \[Kyrios Theos\], “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty \[Pantokrator\].”*”  
**(**[**Re 1:8**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rev%201.8)**)**

A further explanation of what God’s name YHWH really means is given when Moses expresses uncertainty about himself with the words “Who am I?” and receives from God the succinct answer “I am with you” ([Exodus 3:12](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%203.12)). This gives us a clue to what God’s name “YHWH” means. God is not a god who sits on pink clouds somewhere far away from our reality and who demands things from us from time to time. God is a God who is *with us*. When Moses questions his own strength in comparison to Pharaoh, God says that *he* will be with Moses. So Moses may be nothing in himself, but if God is with Moses, all possibilities are there. Just as God walked in the Garden of Eden before the Fall, so too in heaven God will be in our midst, and just as God came to earth 2,000 years ago and walked in our midst and worked miracles. God is not a distant God who is too big for us to come into contact with Him, no, “God is with us”. It is therefore no coincidence that Isaiah prophesies that the Messiah will be called “Immanuel” ([Isa 7:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%207.14)). However, Jesus was not given the name “Immanuel” because it instead describes who he *is*. For “Immanuel” translates directly into English as “God with us” and is an allusion to Jesus being the one in the Trinity who has come down to earth and “is with us”. There is also a clear link here to the answer given to Moses by God: “I am with you”. When Jesus left us and flew up to heaven, he was careful to point out that from now on the Holy Spirit will be “with us”.

>“*Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.*”  
**(**[**Is 7:14**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%207.14)**)**

The answer Moses receives from God is that his name is “ehyeh asher ehyeh” (“I am who I am” in English) and is shortened to “ehyeh” or “I am”. Of course, when Moses was about to say God’s name to the people of Israel, he could not say “*I* am” but instead says “*He* is”, which becomes “YHWH” and is usually pronounced “Yahweh”. So, to be picky, YHWH is not the name that God presents himself with, but the name that Israel uses about God.

So YHWH is the name that Israel was allowed to use about God, but at the same time they were not allowed to misuse God’s name:

>“*And speak to the people of Israel, saying, Whoever curses his God shall bear his sin.* *Whoever blasphemes the name of the Lord \[YHWH\]* *shall surely be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him. The sojourner as well as the native, when he blasphemes the Name, shall be put to death.*”  
**(**[**Le 24:15–16**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Lev%2024.15%E2%80%9316)**)**

Because of this, with the exception of certain solemn occasions in the Temple, Israel was very restrictive in uttering God’s name. When they read the Bible aloud and it said “YHWH”, they read “adonaj” (“lord” in English) instead.

To further remind themselves not to pronounce God’s name Yahweh, the vowels from the word “adonaj” were sometimes used into the word “YHWH” in later Bible translations. In the original Hebrew text, vowels were not used, so when the reader read the consonants YHWH with the vowels from Adonaj, they were reminded to say Adonaj instead of Yahweh. The deliberate mispronunciation if read as written then became “Jehovah”. According to linguists, a more correct and original pronunciation of God’s name is “Yahweh”.

In the New Testament we also find that instead of pronouncing God’s name, it is chosen to say “heaven”. Hence we have the expression “kingdom of heaven” instead of the more common “kingdom of God”, and hence we often say that we are going to *heaven* when we die, when what we really mean is that we are going to *God* when we die.

>“*From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.”*”  
**(**[**Mt 4:17**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%204.17)**)**

When the Old Testament was translated into Greek, they continued to avoid writing “YHWH” and instead wrote the Greek word “kyrios” (“lord” in English). Since kyrios is a relatively common word and does not necessarily refer specifically to “YHWH”, it is sometimes difficult to know whether kyrios in the New Testament refers specifically to the Lord YHWH or some other lord whomever. To find out, one can look up the original Hebrew text when the Old Testament is quoted in the New Testament.

For example, Matthew quotes the prophet Isaiah when describing the mission of John the Baptist:

>“*For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, “The voice of one crying in the wilderness: ‘Prepare the way of the Lord \[Kyrios\]; make his paths straight.’ ”*”  
**(**[**Mt 3:3**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%203.3)**)**  
>  
>“*A voice cries: “In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord \[YHWH\]; make straight in the desert a highway for our God.*”  
**(**[**Is 40:3**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Isa%2040.3)**)**

So here we see that it is not just any lord that John the Baptist will prepare the way for, but none other than “YHWH” himself!

This clear connection between YHWH, Kyrios and Jesus recurs throughout the New Testament, for example when Jesus, in conversation with the Pharisees, says he is “I Am”:

>“*I told you that you would die in your sins, for unless you believe that I am* *\[Ego Eimi\]* *he you will die in your sins.”*”  
**(**[**Jn 8:24**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%208.24)**)**  
>  
>“*Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am \[Ego Eimi\].”* *So they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple.*”  
**(**[**Jn 8:58–59**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%208.58%E2%80%9359)**)**

The reason the Pharisees want to stone Jesus to death is because they believe he has blasphemed the name of the Lord according to the above-mentioned [Leviticus 24:15-16](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Lev%2024.15-16). The Greek words “Ego Eimi” are the exact same words used in the Greek translation of the Old Testament where God presents his name to Moses as “I Am” in [Exodus 3:14](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Exod%203.14). The Pharisees believes Jesus blasphemes the name of the Lord when he calls himself “Ego Eimi” / “I Am”, because that means he calls himself Yahweh. If any other person than Jesus had called himself Yahweh then the Pharisees would be right that he blasphemes, but Jesus is the only one who can truly call himself the Lord Yahweh without blaspheming.

Paul also addresses this topic in Philippians:

>“*who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,* *but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.* *And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.* *Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,* *so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,* *and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.*”  
**(**[**Php 2:6–11**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Phil%202.6%E2%80%9311)**)**

Paul writes that Jesus has been given the name that stands above all other names and clarifies that all should confess that Jesus is “the Lord”. As we have seen before, the word “lord” is sometimes used instead of “YHWH” and to find out which “lord” is meant, one must look at the context. Which name stands above all other names? Well, it is of course YHWH!

Paul writes: “*because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord \[Kyrios\] and believe in your heart that God \[Theos\]  raised him from the dead, you will be saved.* *For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.*” **(**[**Ro 10:9–10**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%2010.9%E2%80%9310)**)**

To base this in the Old Testament, Paul quotes the prophet Joel:

>“*For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord \[Kyrios\]* *will be saved.”*”  
**(**[**Ro 10:13**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rom%2010.13)**)**  
>  
>“*And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord \[YHWH\] shall be saved.*”  
**(**[**Joe 2:32a**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Joel%202.32a)**)**

So what Paul is saying is that if you confess Jesus as the Lord YHWH, you will be saved. An example of such a confession is when Thomas encounters the risen Jesus:

>“*Thomas answered him, “My Lord \[Kyrios\] and my God \[Theos\]!””*  
**(**[**Jn 20:28**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%2020.28)**)**

A further understanding of God’s name is given by linguists who argue that the verb is indefinable; the name could just as easily be “I *was*“, “I *am*” or “I will *be*“. God alludes to this when he says in [Revelation 1:8](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Rev%201.8): *“I am the Alpha and the Omega,” says the Lord God, “who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty”*. So God is the one who has done wonders in the past and whom we are to remember and tell about. God is also the one who is with us today and with whom we can have a relationship. God is also the one who will intervene in the future and we can trust that what he says he will do, he will do.

# Yahweh Sebaot – Lord of Hosts

The Hebrew word (צְבָאָה / sebaot) usually means “armies,” both human and angelic, but can also mean “heavenly bodies” ([Genesis 2:1](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%202.1)). The word “sebaot” is used some 242 times together with God’s name, Yahweh of hosts (יהוה צְבָאוֹת), and is then primarily a description of God as the one who rules over the heavenly armies. For example, when the Israelites and the Philistines are lined up against each other, David says to Goliath:

>“*Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword and with a spear and with a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of hosts \[YHWH Sebaot\], the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.*”  
**(**[**1 Sa 17:45**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/1%20Sam%2017.45)**)**

David comes against a humanly overwhelming enemy backed by a heavenly army and therefore knows that he will win the duel. No matter how great an enemy we face, we are always superior if God is with us. Like when Elisha asks God to open his servant’s eyes to see that God’s army is greater than the army of the Arameans:

>“*When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was all around the city. And the servant said, “Alas, my master! What shall we do?”* *He said, “Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.”* *Then Elisha prayed and said, “O Lord, please open his eyes that he may see.” So the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.*”  
**(**[**2 Ki 6:15–17**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Kings%206.15%E2%80%9317)**)**

More Scriptures about Yahweh Sebaot:

>“*Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host \[sebaot\] of them.*”  
**(**[**Ge 2:1**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Gen%202.1)**)**  
>  
>“*And David arose and went with all the people who were with him from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, which is called by the name of the Lord of hosts \[YHWH Sebaot\] who sits enthroned on the cherubim.*”  
**(**[**2 Sa 6:2**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Sam%206.2)**)**  
>  
>“*Who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts \[YHWH Sebaot\], he is the King of glory! Selah*”  
**(**[**Ps 24:10**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Ps%2024.10)**)**

# Pater, Abba – Father

When Jesus teaches his disciples how to pray, he begins the example prayer ([Matt 6:9](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%206.9)) by calling God “pater” (πατήρ), which in English translates “Father”:

>“*Pray then like this: “Our Father \[Pater\] in heaven, hallowed be your name.*”  
**(**[**Mt 6:9**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Matt%206.9)**)**

“Father” is by far the most common name for God that Jesus himself uses when talking about God. But when Jesus is in prayer, it seems that he rather calls God “Abba” (Ἀββᾶ), which is an Aramaic word (Jesus’ native language) meaning “daddy”:

>“*And he said, “Abba \[Abba\], Father \[Pater\], all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will.”*”  
**(**[**Mk 14:36**](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/Mark%2014.36)**)**

God being our “Father” is linked both to us being “born again” ([John 3:3-8](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/John%203.3-8)) and being “a new creation” ([2 Corinthians 5:17](https://biblia.com/bible/esv/2%20Cor%205.17)) in that we are saved, and to us being made part of God’s people and God’s family in God’s promise to Abraham.

## Jesus – Yeshua

Jesus’ name, Joshua, Yeshua or Yehoshuah, is a contraction of the two Hebrew words “yeho”, which is a word that comes from “YHWH” / “Yahweh”, and “shua” which means “salvation” or “save us!”. So all in all, Jesus’ name becomes “God saves us” or “God the Saviour”, which is very consistent with Jesus being God who became man to save us.

>“*She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus \[Iesous\], for he will save his people from their sins.”*”

We’re picking up this week on our discussion of the four horsemen by taking a good look at the black horsemen and seeing if indeed famine will be coming.  We also shared some practical advice on how to prepare for food shortages.

You may or may not believe that there is a coming famine that is being engineered, but I encourage you to give this a listen.  There have already been messages (even from the President) that a food shortage is coming and as recent as this week, we’ve been told corn, chickpea, tomato products, and more could be sparse on grocery store shelves soon.

We shouldn’t fear, greater is He that is in us than he that is in the world, but we are told to be alert and aware.  Share your thoughts on these questions if you’d like.  I’d love to hear your opinion:

Do you think there is a coming famine?

Do you think the black horse is riding or will be soon?

If yes, what are your thoughts on prayerfully preparing?

I recognize that Jesus had ""fulfilled"" the Law as he said, and in that sense I understand that most of the Mosaic Laws, such as the prohibitions on the consumption of certain food and certain types of sacrifices, probably don't apply to those who have repented and accepted Christ. But later, when he's having the discussion with the rich man over which laws to follow, he notes to follow the commandments.

Why would this be the case? I know later he states that the two greatest commandments, on which all the Law and the Prophets rely, are to love God and love your neighbor as you do yourself. But why specifically uphold the commandments, if the law is fulfilled in the sacrifice of Christ? I know he hasn't been sacrificed yet, but when he expounded upon the two greatest commandments, he hadn't been sacrificed there either.

Are the commandments just good summaries of the way that one might best ensure that they're loving god and their neighbor? Should we just look at the Mosaic Laws as good suggestions for upholding those two commandments now? And if that's not the case, but the 10 commandments still hold weight in themselves, why is that the case as opposed to other Mosaic laws?

Thanks so much.",True
