is8gjyt,Jcholley81,y3ehpy,"Man, I just spent 10 mins going through those pictures and I still don’t see what you’re talking about. And it’s not for lack of experience. 25 year ASE master tech. I’ve done hundreds of drum brake replacements. As far as a shudder, drum brake shudders are the easiest to identify because you can drive at 40-50mph and slightly engage the parking brake and if the shudder is still there it’s definitely in the drum brakes. That being said, it’s not caused by a shoe, it’s caused by an out of round drum. Cheap drums almost always come out of round. I bench lathe every drum I install before hand because of how common it is to get an out of round drum even when buying decent quality ones."
is86umh,Jrod1499,y3ehpy,I think you’ll be alright for a week. You got three other brakes. Just take it easy
is85m6i,-just_browsing,y3ehpy,Rockauto is awesome this sucks man
is8egh2,Tires_N_Wires,y3ehpy,Did you change the drum or have it resurfaced? When I see this type of damage it is often due to a lip on the drum that wasn't machined.
is8qyzc,Itisd,y3ehpy,"That usually happens when someone forces the drum over the shoes, cracking the edge which then breaks off soon afterwards."
is8y6ab,Low-Photograph-4343,y3ehpy,Do you have the primary and secondary mixed? I wouldn't worry about that chip out of the side of the shoe.
is91zil,mrhapyface,y3ehpy,you have the shoes on backwards the shorter one goes towards the front of car the longer one in the rear
is8i05q,Agitated-Joey,y3ehpy,"He thinks the chip in the friction material is what’s causing the vibration. Honestly, I doubt that’s the issue, the brakes aren’t even fully bed in the drums yet, he needs to drive a couple thousand city miles to get those shoes properly worn into the drum, if it doesn’t go away by then, then yea it’s an out of round drum. I’ve seen tons and tons of chips on brake shoes, they don’t cause a vibration, that’s just not how it works, the shoe that has a chip doesn’t make contact with that chip, the raised areas do, that chip doesn’t cause vibration from not contacting the drum in the recessed chipped area."
is8hccr,immortal_avenger,y3ehpy,"You could be right, I certainly won't rule that option out. With that said, there is a clear difference between the shoe I've shown in the pictures and the same shoe on the other side (I'll see if I can add the picture I took of that one). That lip on the side of the shoe definitely isn't there on the other one, it's perfectly flush with the braking material. But it could be both the drum and the shoe for all I know. 

Oddly enough though, the side that's working properly has the same year-old drum from before and is working just fine (though I know I should still get that one lathed)"
is85snz,immortal_avenger,y3ehpy,"Fr, this is stupid. I'm literally in the process of changing jobs, this is terrible timing"
is8fdco,immortal_avenger,y3ehpy,This is a brand new drum
is94a44,immortal_avenger,y3ehpy,"This is the passenger side, they're both on their right sides"
is8ui07,Snake115killa,y3ehpy,"If it makes you feel any better my daily driver i just put all new rotors calipers and pads, well the front driver came seized, either that or the rockys killed it in 20 miles. Im going to blame idaho. Anyways i was replaceing my system  because my stock calipers 114k miles were starting to seize and guess which one was the worst. Yeah tried to put the old caliper back on to drive to work and ended up coming home using my handbrake. Leaked like a mf. I gotta  get to work tho"
is89r63,-just_browsing,y3ehpy,Goodluck on the new job
is8he81,immortal_avenger,y3ehpy,Thank you!
is85t2u,-Bears-Eat-Beets-,y3ego7,"should be fine since the rears do less of the work, and it doesn't appear there is anything protruding past the brake material that could wear a groove into the drum. So you should be alright."
is8ud8d,hsbbdbdhcujdbsb,y3ego7,Just replaced mine we’ll see if autozone is any better
is85y98,immortal_avenger,y3ego7,"That's what I figured, though the protruding metal is showing some shaving. Brake drum seems to be fine for now, though"
irel7cs,lowspeedpursuit,xxzkxd,"Pulse is usually uneven contact of the friction material. You did the shoes and hardware while you were in there, right? If not, that's step one. Step two is to recheck adjustment, then re-set by stomping on the brakes super hard 5-10 times up and down the street. Step 3 is make sure one of the new drums isn't out-of-round. 

Make sure your e-brake's not sticking a bit, as well."
irem4d0,immortal_avenger,xxzkxd,Looks like I'm on step 2 or 3. How can I tell if my drums are out of round and how do I get that fixed?
ireoq76,lowspeedpursuit,xxzkxd,"The one bent drum I ever got was visibly off. Took it back to the store and had it replaced.

When you spin the wheels by hand to check the drag on your adjustment, is the drag consistent, or do you already have the pulse? If it's pulsing already, something about the way the parts fit together is out-of-whack. Can you isolate it to one side? 

I've had a bad drum, I've been given the wrong shoes, I've had parking brake sticking, and I've had hydraulics sticking. I've had a bent axle flange--although the odds of that presenting suddenly after a brake job are pretty low.

If you only get the pulse actually driving, that opens up the door to ABS/hydraulic problems."
ireu9jh,immortal_avenger,xxzkxd,"Seem to have more pulse on the passenger side when I turn it by hand. I remember this side being a pain to put together, I'll have to pop her open and check. This side also got a new drum, though I couldn't spot any visible issues when it spun"
irf3z9e,lowspeedpursuit,xxzkxd,"If you have the old drums, pop them--or just the pass.--back on and see if the problem persists. If not, the new pass. drum is fairly suspect. You can also kind of knock the entire shoe assembly left and right a bit on the plate, but that should be fairly self-aligning once you get under way."
irgde3e,immortal_avenger,xxzkxd,"Old drum is too far gone, I'm afraid"
irgi34z,lowspeedpursuit,xxzkxd,"No worries. You can also swap the new drums side-to-side and see if the pulse follows along or stays on passenger. 

If you remember the pass. side being a pain to fit together, something in there's probably just jammed or dragging in the wrong spot. I can't remember if it's on the 9"" or 10"" setup, but I had a wheel where that stupid cable that runs down to the star adjuster absolutely would not stay seated in its groove."

iprsoqa,anonymouslosername,xmz28v,"Are you looking to add 70cm in the future as well? If so, it might be worth going with a dual band (2m/70cm antenna) over a 2m only...then you can swap to a dual band radio, or ad a 70cm monoband and a diplexer to feed both radios to one antenna. (My base is 2 monoband commercial decks into a diplexer to a dual band comet gp1)

If 70cm is no-go, focus on 2m only antennas, aa theres generally some compromise to working in both, and why have any compromise of you aren't going to use 70cm?

ipsz83r,anonymouslosername,xmz28v,"Glad to help! 

Since I came at it from the 70cm side (via gmrs), if I were doing it again I'd skip the matching 2m deck and just gotten a dual band. (70cm is more prevalent here also)."

irao6wo,RECIPR0C1TY,xx8rxl,"I think verse 14 answers this for you. 

>Even Gentiles, who do not have God’s written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it.

The point being that they (we) are created with an innate and natural knowledge of the law. We all know we break God's law, and therefore we are responsible for it even though we haven't received a written law."
iraxi68,TroutFarms,xx8rxl,"It makes more sense if you read the entire chapter. Paul is pointing out that being Jewish doesn't give you an advantage if you don't even follow the law. What matters isn't what you know, but whether you actually live it out. The last part of it makes this clear:

>Romans 2:28-29  It isn’t the Jew who maintains outward appearances who will receive praise from God, and it isn’t people who are outwardly circumcised on their bodies. Instead, it is the person who is a Jew inside, who is circumcised in spirit, not literally. That person’s praise doesn’t come from people but from God.

Paul is basically saying it's better to be a gentile who follows the law even though they don't even know it than to be a Jewish person who knows the law and fails to follow it.

Edit: To fully understand it though, you can't stop at that chapter. Paul isn't done making his point; in chapter 3 he's going to reveal that even that obedience to the law he was talking about winds up being irrelevant since it is Christ's obedience that saves Jew and Gentile alike."
irasad2,thegoodfight24,xx8rxl,"OP, have you looked at the verse ONLY in the NLT?"
irayjmu,PerfectlyCalmDude,xx8rxl,"The ESV says:

11 For God shows no partiality.  
12 For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.

Now, as a continued study of Romans will reveal, sin results in death/perishing. Those who do not have the law who have sinned, will perish without the law. Those who do have the law are expected to follow it, there are judgments within it and those who sinned according to the law are judged by the law. 

Make sense?"
irb15le,creed_bratton_,xx8rxl,"If you read verses 14 and 15 it kind of clarifies what's being said. 

Essentially what it's saying is that people who don't know the Law still have a conscience about what's right and wrong. 

""they are a law for themselves""

If you do something that goes against your conscience, then you are breaking your own Law, and guilty of sin. But it goes both ways! Notice at the end of verse 15 it says their conscience can accuse them of sin OOOR defend them. 

So for example if someone does not know the law of God but does what their conscience believes is right, that would be then following the ""law"" that's written on their heart.

However most people (including me) are hypocrites and cannot even live up to their own ideas of right and wrong. They are condemned by their own conscience."

ALL of these lands were occupied by people who had never heard The Truth, but they certainly heard what happened to Egypt 😁 because they rejected The Universal Government of Christianity of Always be Fair, genuinely care and always share. 

So those Nations that accepted co- inhabiting with the Isrealites did well, but those who rejected the universal government of Christianity, were taken down by the Isrealites.

iteh13a,RationalThoughtMedia,yb31v2,Seek in prayer God's will. His guidance and direction. Seek His wisdom to grow in your faith. In fact that may exactly be what is going on. God wanting you to trust Him. Not with Feelings but flat out faith.
iteknjx,Gigithemuppet,yb31v2,"I have had friends who went through similar things.My advice is to continue seeking and not turn to other things instead of God to fill the void. Sure it would be too easy if we've always felt His presence but sometimes we're tested (idk if you are) . Still you have to keep running the race. As most people said, it's a relationship,it's not just remembering to read bible and pray,it's to keep Him always in your heart and pray from the heart."
itef76q,Turbulent-Driver-232,yb31v2,"I'm at a similar point as you but I think that we sometimes forget that God doesn't always answer on our time or in our way.

Just because it feels like he isn't listening, I promise you he is. I prayed for help on something I was struggling with for years but he finally answered my prayers. All that time I felt like he wasn't listening, but he was. His time just wasn't what I wanted but he still cared and answered. 

I've also been more casual about how I talk to God, which may not work for everyone but has helped me. Instead of making prayer feel like a chore or daily obligation, I just started praying while doing the dishes or taking a walk. I simply talk to him like my friend. I thank him for my wonderful life, I ask him for advice, I share my worries, all of it. Praying doesn't always have to be rigid and formal. It is about connecting with God the best way you can. Even a diary journal to God can help you feel closer. 

I've also found engaging with other Christians has helped me feel the love of God up close.

itemfhv,JayMag23,yb31v2,"Belief or faith in the Father and His Son as your Lord and Savior is the starting point, which I assume you embrace. Next, involves prayer and reading the Word as a way to grow closer to God, in a relationship with Him.

Next, involves coming to a point of Heartfelt Repentance. Scripture is full of calls to repent. This ""godly sorrow"" for one's sins and offence to God is something that often takes time, reading His Word and prayer asking for this gift of godly sorrow from God. 

Once received, godly sorrow, then it becomes a matter of asking for God's forgiveness from the heart.

The next step is asking for the Holy Spirit to abide, (baptism) which makes you His, a Christian,  which will provide you ""conviction of sin,"" among other gifts, to guide your process of sanctification.

""For you are all children of God through faith in Christ Jesus. And all who have been united with Christ in baptism have put on Christ, like putting on new clothes. There is no longer Jew or Gentile, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. And now that you belong to Christ, you are true children of Abraham.

That comes with time.  The more you understand God, the more you will understand how much God loves us and has done for us.

It's kind of different for us as God isn't with us in the flesh like Jesus was.  We don't have that one-on-one interaction.  Mostly God communicates with us through the spirit.  Rarely is it the Voice From Heaven.

As humans, we are used to a give-and-take communication.  So it is different with God mostly.

Here is a helpful verse:

""Be still and know that I am God.""

Sometimes we have to just be quiet.  Prayer time is mostly us talking to God.  Sometimes we just need to be quiet and listen."
iten7jc,PastelChristian,yb31v2,"Okay, thank you :>"
isp6w74,spamjwood,y6gjhq,"Here is the rule of thumb that I use...

My understanding of ""sober-minded"" is that it's the ability to exercise sound judgment. We are called multiple times in the NT to exercise this. So, if the amount of alcohol I've consumed compromises my ability to exercise sound judgment I am no longer simply merry (biblical) but drunk (sinful).

There are many many variables that would cause one to cross from merriment to drunkenness. This isn't the place to go into all of them but the goal at all times would be to exercise caution since there are many things that are permissible but not beneficial (1 Cor 6:12). If one has inadvertently crossed into drunkenness then confess the sin, repent, and move forward with more caution under God's grace."

7 Let them drink and forget their poverty  
and remember their misery no more.

Drunkenness can lead to bad behavior, to forgetting your responsibilities, or to sloth. For someone with high levels of responsibility, maybe a little bit of drinking is bad. For someone without, it might be a little different. Drinking to remember your misery no more is a lot more than a little bit of a buzzy feeling.

I'd suggest that if the president were too drunk to be at his highest level of awareness in an emergency, or your pastor is too drunk to get to the hospital and discharge his duties in an emergency, that's a moral failing. I think that if you give a dying person enough morphine to get to a different level of existence, that's not."
isp4byg,Spentworth,y6gjhq,"Given that self-control is a fruit of the Spirit, I personally feel I have gone too far whenever alcohol would make me act in a way, or make a choice, that I would have likely not done otherwise. Knowing how much alcohol does that to you is a matter of self-discernment but I think it's better to be cautious that gung-ho."
isp94kx,hester_grey,y6gjhq,Basically if you're down the pub and find you can no longer say 'Mephibosheth' it's time to stop.
ispiou6,judewriley,y6gjhq,"Self-control. 

As I’ve pointed out before, the line with drunkenness  is how much/how often does it take to make you lose self-control. This both counts as an immediate loss of self control (getting passed out drunk, unable to maintain your own faculties) and extended loss of self control (developing a dependency or an addiction where you can't reasonably function without it). This isn't something objective, but can be different for different people (and is definitely different for different substances - it takes a lot less opium to lose self control than it takes alcohol for example). 

A person can generally know when they've crossed that line for themselves."
ispn3r2,yogirunner528,y6gjhq,"It depends on the situation, IMO, with a limit that I should never cross no matter the situation. If I have to drive? One drink. If I am at a work function? Probably the same. If my husband and I are sitting on our patio enjoying the weather with nowhere to go? 2-3 might be appropriate. But anymore than that and my judgment begins to be impaired and that’s where it crosses the line for me."
ispvoeo,SCCock,y6gjhq,"&#x200B;

You can be merry and still in control.

I would say if drink enough to be obnoxious jerk  you have crossed the line."

isq5lmq,swcollings,y6gjhq,"Christian ethics are virtue-based; every sin listed in the New Testament is the absence of one of about a dozen virtues. Drunkenness would be perhaps the lack of self-control, someone who *cannot* refrain from drinking to excess."
iss7cab,erythro,y6gjhq,"Good discussion so far, adding in the mix: Jesus turning water into wine.  The implication of John 2:10 was that Jesus was giving a *lot* of wine to people who had already had their judgement (somewhat) affected by wine."
isq8fwf,gpowells,y6gjhq,"If I’ve drunk so much I can no longer articulate the Gospel clearly, I’ve gone too far."
ispuphg,Wydsl,y6gjhq,"I would be more curious how people answer this in regards to caffeine. Caffeine is not a neutral substance and does cause a “high.” I’ve heard many in the church excuse its effects & affects away for various reasons. But, are you actually sober? Or are its effects & affects just socially acceptable? Similar question, but with sugar?  These things that are accepted in the church, but actually have an ENORMOUS psychological and physiological affect and effect. What does being “sober-minded” actually mean?!"
ist1jms,Short-Resource915,y6gjhq,"This is super arbitrary, but what I think is that for any person under 6 feet and 200 pounds, 2 drinks per day is the maximum. If you are significantly over 6 feet AND 200 pounds, 3 drinks. But if you are significantly over 200 pounds, and not over 6 feet, still 2 drinks. I’m a woman, so I follow the 2 drink rule. I know it matters if you are hydrated, if you drink on a full stomach, etc, but this simple rule works for me. 

Or maybe I should just say that for myself 64 YO female, 5’6”, overweight but not 200 pounds, 2 drinks is my max. And I only drink 3-4 times per month, but I would be comfortable with the same intake daily, but I only care to drink when I am in a group for a nice meal."
istpczq,OneEyedC4t,y6gjhq,"There really isn't a standard so I'll just give my personal opinion.

First we obey the law so Romans 13 would speak to this. If it meets society's standard for intoxication in terms of either driving drunk or intoxication laws then we need to obey those laws and not break them.

Second of all the point is that we should be filled with the spirit rather than just being drunk so in my opinion only one standard glass of wine or one beer basically the agreed upon definition of one standard drink of alcohol. With liquor and other harder substances I think there is a standard for how much one shot is so I would recommend going by that.

I believe that when you look at scripture you see that it uses phrases like ""the person who is deceived by alcohol is not wise."""
isq6jfp,stephen250,y6gjhq,"Wine in biblical times, including the wedding feast, was only 1-3% alcohol and nowhere near as strong as it is in our day. I consider anything that gets you “buzzed” or changed the way you think to be too much."
isp525o,Post_Tenebras_Lux77,y6gjhq,"“Biblical heart gladdening effects “? What exactly does this mean ?  Very fine line my friend here and imo there is no room for alcohol or any mind altering substance in a believers life.  Alcoholic beverages 2000 years ago are not the same as today.

ispm8kp,be_rational_please,y6gjhq,"I think it is .02 bal.  If you're a less than safe driver,  right at that point stop.  If you got a buzz stop.  Don't drive.

If you start waking up with wounds you can't explain, you probably should stop drinking and start repenting.

I was raised sbc.  I still feel the weight of the nonalcohol whenever I see a bottle of wine, but there simply is no text that forbids it."
isq92qk,mongoose-american,y6gjhq,"Getting drunk and being a drunkard are two different things. Drunkardness is sinful, get uncontrollably drunk would also be sinful, getting drunk once in a while at a wedding or some other celebration is not."
ispd0h6,atropinecaffeine,y6gjhq,"Yep.

I also would offer that one night (after good hydration and a big meal), 2 drinks wouldn’t even phase someone but the next time (dehydrated and hungry), 1 drink can go straight to the head."
ispe74k,anewhand,y6gjhq,"Your second point is an interesting one, and one I’ve thought about a bit. Here in Scotland the drink-drive limit is basically half a beer. Say I have one beer with dinner and then can’t legally drive to an unexpected call from the hospital for an emergency, or to someone in need - what then?"
isp5c4e,solnuschka,y6gj03,"Maybe the ""gladdening effects"" just mean being tipsy? I think there is a clear difference between tipsy people and drunk people. 

Most of the time, you know you've crossed that line when other people tell you... 🙃   
You should have a feeling of yourself though and know when it is time to stop."
isp8ij5,BoatLikeAFlutterby,y6gj03,"People over-complicate it. I think it’s quite similar to eating. Gluttony is a sin. BUT HOW MUCH FOOD IS TOO MUCH FOOD?!?! Idk, I think you just have to be a grown-up and eat more slowly, and when your tummy feels full, ask for a to-go box. Y’know?

With alcohol, if you can’t safely and legally drive, if you are behaving differently than you typically would, if you’re touching everyone’s faces and telling them how much you love them, if you realize that everything is hilarious to you all of a sudden, or if you go to the restroom only to realize you’ve already peed your pants, maybe dial it back next time.

As with most things, having godly friends who share your standards is a good way to stay in check too."
isp6wzq,UsagiHakushaku,y6gj03,"Honestly I have no idea , but I see how drunk people act . They do things they wouldn't do when they're sober , they're more likelly to flirt etc.

&#x200B;

Thier whole pesonality shifts when they are drunk. If they wanted to be happy they would be more happy , if they were sad and depressed they would be even more sad and depressed but more open about it."
isphnr1,GregJ7,y6gj03,"IMO, you've crossed the line when your judgment is impaired or your thinking is altered—and definitely when you inhibitions change. I believe that if the alcohol is making you feel good or tipsy, you've crossed the line because it has changed how you look at things. We are accountable for every word spoken to God.

*The end of all things is near. Therefore be clear minded and self-controlled so that you can pray.* (1 Peter 4:7, 1984 NIV)

*Be self-controlled and alert. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour.* (1 Peter 5:8, 1984 NIV)"
isq4mch,BlueSwordOfFire,y6gj03,"It depends on the person. Some people can have 5 beers and someone else can have 2 beers before they start to lose control. It is the losing control which we all should be aware of. Being tipsy is the beginning of losing control and if continued leads to drunkness and being unable to resist temptations from within and without.

1 Peter 5:8- Be sober [well balanced and self-disciplined], be alert and cautious at all times. That enemy of yours, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion [fiercely hungry], seeking someone to devour."
ispgf7h,In_Defilade,y6gj03,"Bear in mind that wine in biblical times was likely not nearly as strong as the wine that is available now.  Mankind puts lots of effort into increasing worldly pleasure in every area.  We have altered Gods creation, most of the time for the worse.  


John MacArthur has a good series of lectures on Christians and Alcohol:  https://youtu.be/thXe-rtpl6U"
ispvq62,goodwid,y6gj03,"To my mind the difference is in the patterns. Are you a glutton because you went to a celebratory meal and stuffed yerself silly?  No.  Are you a drunk because you have a few beers each weekend during football season? No.  

In these instances, in my opinion it's the pattern that forms that is the problem, and more importantly, it's the importance you place on the activity.  Is going out friday and saturday nights every weekend to get hammered a part of your identity? You might be a drunkard.  Do you routinely prepare huge amounts of food, stuff yourself, and waste the rest?  You might be a glutton.  If you instead spend every saturday preparing huge amounts of food to feed friends and strangers, and serve wine and beer, and people get happy, is that gluttony or drunkenness?  Or is it service to your community?  

So often it's the nuances that make the action sinful or otherwise.  Blanket declarations of X Y or Z being a sin are rarely accurate."
it1klkn,emojo_ko,y6gj03,"I’m not an expert, but i’d say it’s safe to say stay away from getting the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Like, maybe one less glass from the “tipsy” line, just because it’s easy to have too much. I don’t drink, but that is the approach that I would take if I was to."
isp64zl,solnuschka,y6gj03,"Galatians 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, and **self-control**. Against such things there is no law."

Please consider guarding your heart and mind from the damage it does."
isp4ulu,Byzantium,y6gjxu,"My take is that if it allows you to do things that you later regret, it is excessive."
isp5vil,brewerkid,y6gjxu,"It's about it impairing your judgment, as well as affecting your faculties. A drink and a slight buzz that just makes you feel better is fine, if you can't balance, you've definitely gone too far. It's a good practice to simply not even try to find the line. I limit myself to two beers or a single cocktail. I know that's not enough to get me close to drunk, I could probably have more, but it's not worth finding out where that line is."
isprthb,NihilisticNarwhal,y6gjxu,"Jesus creates more wine at a wedding that was in danger of running out. That, at the very least, is an endorsement of drinking (and perhaps even drunkenness) as part of a celebration. So I think that the Christians who condemn all drinking go too far. But I don't think anywhere in the Bible can be found an example of bad behavior being excused on account of alcohol. You're still responsible for what you do while drunk, so celebrate accordingly."

it6sodd,artgreendog,y9ddv8,"A sampling of heaven: A river, clear as crystal, will flow from the throne of God and of the Lamb [Jesus] down the middle of the city. On each side of the river, there will be a tree of life, yielding twelve kinds of fruit every month. The streets will be pure gold, like transparent glass. The walls of the city will be adorned with every kind of jewel, emerald, onyx, amethyst, topaz, etc. There will be no need for the sun or moon, and no need for a temple or church. The presence of the Lord will be its light.

However, the real beauty of heaven is this:   
""Now the dwelling of God is with men, and he will live with them. They will be his people, and God himself will be with them and be their God. He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away...I am making everything new.""

Heaven belongs to Jesus. He created it. ""For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible...all things were created through him and for him.""

Though Jesus initially came to the earth as a Savior, he will one day sit as Judge. All people will experience a bodily resurrection from the dead, and all will appear before the judgment seat of Christ.

You may have to continue resisting a little bit longer, and when I say a little bit longer, I mean a very short time. Because the enemy of your soul has no virtue. He has no ability to endure with those who are trusting the Lord.

According to Mormon doctrine, ""heavenly father"" is a man just like we are, except he has been exalted to           become a god. He had sex with his heavenly wives (this is why polygamy is important) to create ""spirit           children"" to fill the humans born on earth. Adam and Eve retained their knowledge of heaven after coming           
to earth.           
If you do enough good works, temple marriage (and much more) you can work your way to become a god.           And the whole cycle starts again with you.

itec0ig,NightmareHolic,yb16v1,">Anything other than that falls outside the realm of Gods wish for your soul.

I disagree with this part. Sex can be for marital intimacy. I don't think you have to have sex for children. You can engage in sex for bonding with your wife/husband. There's nothing wrong with that. This is where Christians are too extreme, and they tell people that married Christians have to have children, then the ones who have health problems, genetic problems, or simply don't want to have children feel shamed and guilty for it.

There were married people in the Bible who were infertile, who begged God for children, but I don't think it would have been sinful for them to simply not want to have children. That's my stance. If they never asked God for children, would they have remained infertile? Would that have made their marriages any less unifying? I don't think so. I think they could still have sex for intimacy and bonding.

Paul acts like sex could be used in marriage to satisfy a burning passion. Sex within marriage is undefiled, and prevents you from fornication/etc. So, there seems to be reasons beyond just intercourse for children, IMO. What happens if you have burning passion, but you don't want children? I don't think it would be wrong to marry, satisfy yourself with your wife/husband, and still not have children. Are they just to burn with passion forever and commit fornication if they can't control themselves, simply because they don't want children? That's not pragmatic.

itgi9mu,Aniolel1,yb16v1,"To those who are say who say they are Christian, but support same sex marriage, I encourage all of you to read the Bible thoroughly, for the Bible makes it abundantly clear that marriage is between a man and a woman(Matthew 19:4-5; Gen.2:18). In Paul letters to Corinthians, he offered his instructions on this in 1 Corinth 7.  He also wrote about gender roles in in roles in marriage(Eph 5:22-32).  Marriage was also designed for sexual desire and intimacy(song of Solomon)."
itgickf,PuzzleheadRobo,yb16v1,"This is great! Glad to find a like-minded believer who struggles with SSA. I do believe God wants us to marry the opposite sex as he intended and not become celibate though. Of course, our battle is a hard one and for many, achieving that takes a lot of reflection, discipline-building and overcoming fears, insecurities, misunderstandings about how we relate to the same and opposite genders before one gets there. So abstaining does need to happen in the mean time. But I think God does not want that for our whole lives.

From what I recall in Scripture, celibacy is meant for an active, full-time dedication to God’s mission, not as a solution to sexual disorder or any other sin. As we close the gap of deficit in ourselves, the power of SSA diminishes and we get more clarity and confidence in living as a opposite sex attracted individual. It will never be as easy as heterosexual folks, but it’s completely possible. We just need to be open-minded to it. Hopefully that’s a bit encouraging to those like us and informative for those who aren’t."

Please provide your references. 

Also, why would it be a good idea to encourage married couples to have children when there are chances that they will have LGBTQ+ children?

Why is it a good idea, given what you believe and are preaching, to allow parents to give the free gift of life, only to sucker punch them when they reach sexual maturity/awareness in that they are prohibited from acting on their body’s desires to enjoy sexual intimacy with the person that they want, while they watch their peers and relatives enjoy sexual intimacy with the person that they want? And to add insult to injury, depending on where they live, they can be hated/despised/unacceptable by family members, brutally beaten, persecuted, and/or murdered just for being different.

Drink water. 

Tomorrow try two meals. 

I can't go more than one day because of the type of work I do, but God has blessed me for making it a weekly practice. 

If you want to go for 40 days, start with one day, then two, one week,  then two. With a day or two of rest in between. Don't go cold Turkey into 40 days, your probably won't make and you'll beat yourself up over it.

Like anything else in your body, it's a self discipline and training, no different than you should start running regularly if you want to run a marathon. 

The most important part is actually the prayer, make lists for if you run out of things to pray about. If you are easily distracted, find a way to get away from whatever you can. I have ADD, I need a partial distraction in order to Focus, I can keep from daydreaming in prayer if I walk while praying. My wife writes out her prayers for the same reason. 

Just be aware that you are going to be attacked and distracted like never before. Satan has more to fear from a fasting saint than ten people who aren't fasting. You will be invited to restaurants by coworkers, someone will bring in donuts, pizza for lunch, or food for whatever reason. 

Stick with it, prayer warriors are the ones who gain the closest relationship with God, other than those he allows great sorrow or sickness on to draw them closer to him.

In the study of shepherd's like David, we find that the lambs who were most often wandering away would be singled out by the shepherd. If they still tended to wander, he would break one of their legs, set it, and then carry that lamb on his shoulders until the leg healed.

After that much contact with the shepherd, that lamb would be nervous if they couldn't smell or hear the shepherd nearby. 

This caused them to always follow as close to him as they could, and once the shepherd saw this he would hang a bell on them. 

If the flock was ever scattered or separated, the other sheep know to follow the bell sheep, because they will not rest until they find the shepherd. 

By choosing to fast, or obeying the call to fast, you are seeking a closer walk with the shepherd, without the rod of correction in your life."

Fasting is powerful. But one usually has to build up to it because we’ve been ruled by the flesh for so long. Some people think they can’t miss a day without food. While that may be true for some with medical conditions for others it’s just in the mind. 

Just remember the purpose for fasting is to bring clarity to our hearts and minds, seeing the goodness of God clearer as we yield ourselves to a time of intense focus in the Spirit. 

I’ve been successful at certain times and certain times not. I never get condemned about it, God never gets upset about it. If I feel tortured because I’m so hungry he says, go eat, lol. 

My experience has always been to get my focus off of food and onto the realities of the word. I have had some most incredible experiences in fasting but often they come after the fast is over.

Lastly, related to your vision it doesn’t contend well with the Bible at all. Only a few people have ever had a real vision of Heaven. For example, the apostle Paul did so and in the book of Corinthians stated he could not describe in words what he saw or experienced. In other words, it was way beyond what we can comprehend based on our natural experiences on earth. Jesus in John 3 alluded to this when he refuted the religious leaders for not understanding basic tenets of salvation which are simple compared to concepts well beyond earthly experiences contained in heaven. The visions of God in Ezekiel and Revelation are hard to comprehend and the writers of the Bible struggled to put pen to paper what they saw unlike your very simplistic vision.

Sorry, I can't help poking a little bit of fun. More seriously, Jesus told Peter to cast his nets on the other side of the boat and by doing so Peter caught so much fish that they nearly capsized. Jesus broke some fish up into pieces for the crowd around him to eat. Jesus told Peter to go catch a fish where he would find the money to pay their taxes.

That's just on fish specifically."
it4uu1x,PerfectlyCalmDude,y9a41p,"Jesus ate fish and lamb. There is nothing wrong with consuming God's creatures, he gave them to us for food after the flood. Not all Christians agree with me on this, but I see any sense or notion of it being morally superior in any way to not eat meat as claiming, however tacitly, to be better than Jesus in this area. No human being is, was, or will be morally superior to Jesus in any way. 

This does not mean that those with health reasons for abstaining from meat cannot do so, nor does it compel people to eat meat which may or may not have been sacrificed to an idol. Technically, it doesn't mean that you must eat meat that was factory farmed either (all meat Jesus would have eaten, due to his Jewish heritage, would have been kosher which has a higher standard of animal treatment than the factory farms that stick out as the bad examples). 

Likewise, drinking wine in moderation is not wrong - Jesus drank it in moderation on many occasions. For those who are alcoholics or live with alcoholics, it is necessary to abstain but that is the exception, not the rule.

Outside of food sacrificed to idols and consuming the blood of birds and land animals, there are no general prohibitions of what to eat in the New Testament. Outside of these two, let health reasons, love for your neighbor, and your palate guide your choices for food and drink."

Genesis lays out clearly what he made, what we are supposed to eat, and all that he gave us as food.  Leviticus outlines what is good food and bad food, like eating most crawling bugs that elites are now wanting us to eat.  Eating scaled fish is ok, but eating non scaled fish is not.  No shrimp and other bottom feeders are meant to clean the oceans.  But Jesus said that God made all things clean so that you can eat anything in thanksgiving to God.

‭‭Genesis‬ ‭9‬:‭2‬-‭3‬

That’s pretty specific terms in which God is telling Noah that, while Adam was only given plants to eat, God is now giving him every living animal to eat as food as well.

That said, there is an ethical case to be made that it is a moral kindness to avoid eating meat, if you live in circumstances that allow you to be healthy without killing animals. But there’s a difference between something that is a kind gesture to a living creature and a moral requirement.

From a practical perspective, most fish are far less capable of experiencing the trauma of physical pain than most mammals are. They have an aversive response to stimuli that threaten their safety, but the science seems to indicate that their experience of pain is nothing like that of a dog, for instance. Shellfish lack brains and, accordingly, lack the ability to experience pain at all, so I’ve known several folks who will eat shellfish to supplement an otherwise vegan diet, including a philosophy of ethics professor, who abstains from meat on ethical grounds and has studied the science on shellfish way more than I have.

In any case, you are certainly free in Christ to eat animals, and you need not impose a moral burden on yourself for doing so. If you choose to abstain, I think it’s both unnecessary and very respectable."

I do not believe God cares whether you are heterosexual or homosexual.

God cares whether or not you are a liar

----†-----

God does not care whether women preach to men in Church.

He does not care whether the Sabbath is on Saturday or Sunday or Tuesday

Nor whether we eat meat or just vegetables.

He does not care if we have more than one wife really - or husband - if this is the societal context we are living in.

Treat them well. Be fair. You will know what is not right.

Homosexuals are not evil. Homosexuality is not a sin in itself.

Heterosexuals are not evil. Heterosexuality is not a sin in itself.

Everyone is fallen and redemption has nothing to do with not being homosexual.

Homosexual sex - on-going and willful - is no different from heterosexual sex - on-going and willful.

God is not going to be checking down trousers and up skirts because - homosexual

Sin is something else entirely.

And the Gospel is not - don't be Homosexual

-----†-----

We utterly miss the point

This is sin:

-----†-----

 - *""...every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity, envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice, gossips, slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; inventors of ways of doing evil, disobedient to their parents, with no understanding, no fidelity, no love, no mercy.....""*

This is all. It is the same for everybody.

Every Christian will be called by Christ to look at sin in their lives. For homosexuals it could be greed, or lust, or anger - like anyone else.

The verses about homosexuality in the Bible contextualize men who sleep with men as wrongdoers who cheat, are idolators and adulterers, are thieves, greedy and drunk, are otherwise in some way corrupted - not just because they sleep with men.

- *For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like a mortal human being and birds and animals and reptiles.*

So men who were sleeping with men were already bad people - not just your regular Joe being a good Christian

Somewhere, somehow, homosexuality was connected with sin.

In fact - Jesus comes and says nothing at all - except that we leave gender and sex here in the dust, along with money when we die. They do not follow us where we are going. Be clean about what you are doing.

Then it becomes clear for me how to understand sin and what repentance is - and how these verses apply to me;

- *The acts of the flesh are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law.*

It's not just because people are homosexual and have Homosexual sex.

Sin is not a list from the Bible - this is exactly what Jesus came to say

Sin is deeper than this

I think we will find a God who asks us just how much simpler we needed it to be.

Okay, I think I figured it out, you just actually aren't using the Bible as the basis for your beliefs. If you were, you would know that there is undoubtedly judgment with God. What baffles and saddens me is that you seemingly don't care what the Bible teaches about God and His character and justice, but are still apparently so homophobic. That means that it is coming from yourself and your own mean-spiritedness, rather than biblical conviction of any kind.

&#x200B;

>an LGBTQ+ marriage isn't a true marriage in the eyes of God.

What about the marriage of a male and female bisexual? That's LGBTQ+ marriage. What about the marriage of one or two asexuals? That's LGBTQ+ marriage as well. Ooh! What about the marriage of two transgender persons, who were both born as and transitioned into opposite genders from one another? So far you seem to be lacking in grounds to condemn that, but it's *definitely* LGBTQ+ marriage.

&#x200B;

>The bottom line is that LGBTQ+ sex and marriage are sins.

So far nothing you've said has proven that. If all you've said is true, it really only means that **gay** sex and marriage are allegedly sins. That's so very different from LGBTQ+ in general, stop trying to make them the same.

&#x200B;

>I pray that God will reveal in your heart the truth.

I'm praying the same for you, OP. Because right now you are incredibly confused and misguided."

Their passion is their biological clock ticking away, wanting to procreate and reproduce the human species. The sex hormones are supposed to be addictive and pleasurable because it ensures that sex is frequent enough in order to maximise the chance of pregnancy.

Infernalism is unbiblical.  This is what the bible teaches:  God never warned Adam about hell. God didn't put hell as a warning in the law of Moses. Israel goes through a refiners fire in the future. The ""lake of fire"" involves brimstone, and brimstone was used to refine gold back in the day. Gentiles will be taught God's laws in the future.

itag12h,vegdout,ya3et8,Look into Universalism. Not Unitarian Universalism but the kind many of the early church father’s like Origen believed in.
ita5prd,jereman75,ya3et8,"I understand you. My earliest childhood memory is not being able to sleep thinking about all of the people going to hell: kids, people from foreign countries, all kinds of people who haven’t been saved. It was late at night but my mother tried to console me. When I asked her about it she couldn’t really console me because we were raised Baptist and she firmly believed anyone who was not “saved” would go to be tormented in hell. She tried to distract me instead with a kid’s book. 

That was probably the beginning of my questioning and doubting about Christianity. I went to church regularly, read the Bible, prayed often and earnestly listened to the pastors and teachers, was saved (at least once) but never could quite accept the reality of eternal torment. 

I know now that there are other Christian views on hell.  But this early exposure to eternal torment for non-saved people kept me from being able to accept the Christianity I had been taught."
it910pv,HonestGodQuestions,ya3et8,"The idea of hell as eternal conscious torment may be the majority view in Christianity, but it's far from the only one! For instance, I'm a Universalist, I think everyone will get to heaven eventually and that, in the end, hell will be empty."

We don't give up on people, as Christians, so why would God? These people \*know\* God exists and reject Him, they reject the way of goodwill and charity and being good people. They are hateful people that given infinite chances will still choose to hate and kill and murder and rape. 

I'm telling you as a fact that God does not give up on people and does not eternally torture anyone, they choose their fate and choose it over and over despite good advice."
itcxivr,Howling2021,ya3et8,"In traditional Hebrew belief, YHWH never created a place for eternal damnation and torture of human souls. Nor is it believed that heaven is a potential destination for human souls.

When the Hebrews spoke of the salvation of God, it pertained to their belief that when a human being died, whether Jew or Gentile, YHWH would reclaim the soul, reconcile the soul to Himself, and then send the soul to dwell with other souls in a paradise He'd created especially for human souls, there to await together the Day of Judgment.

On that day, if God judged a soul to have lived a righteous or at least decent or compassionate life, that soul was immediately returned to their home in that paradise.

If God judged a soul to have lived a sinful life, or committed crimes meriting punishment, the punishment which YHWH would pronounce was never eternal or infinite in duration, but only for such amount of time as He deemed necessary to correct and chastise the soul, and there is nothing written of what this punishment was, or if it involved inflicting pain or terror.

When the period of punishment was completed, these chastised souls would also be returned to their homes in that paradise for human souls, because this was to be their eternal dwelling place.

This would have been what the Palestinian Jew Jesus was talking about, when he promised the thief on the cross that on that very day he'd be in paradise. He wasn't promising the thief eternity in heaven in God's presence, or that he wouldn't be subjected to judgment on the Day of Judgment."

itagvja,MitchellDenham,ya3et8,"This may be seen as heretical, or un-Christian, but I simply do not believe in an afterlife. The very idea is irrational and abhorrent to me.


Eternal reward or punishment for a finite life is absurd, furthermore a literal Heaven sounds tedious and boring - almost like a spiritual North Korea, and a literal Hell makes no rational sense - if you’re a generous and kind person, you can still be punished because you “rejected” God, yet a decidedly evil person like Jeffrey Dahmer can go to Heaven because he repented and came to God despite being evil incarnate up until then. What is the rationale there? Seems extremely unjust to me.


I see no need, and have no want, for an afterlife - and my lack of believing there is one adds more value to this one life I have.


The life we have is far too nuanced and complicated to result in a black and white ruling at the end as to whether you are “rewarded” or “punished”."

Have you dreamt you were eating and drinking and had pleasure of that. He said yes. I said: have you dreamt laughing and crying, and strolling in the cities that haven't seen yet but you know the specialties. He said: yes dreamt very much. I said:  Have you ever dreamt about your dead brother or father and know them like they are alive.  
He said: yes too many times. I said: tell me which sense has received such things to see the dead and talking to them or crying and laughing. He said: I can’t say which one. Because the body is asleep like a dead. I said: tell me when you wake up don’t you remember and report to the friends exactly, He said; yes and sometimes I see that before night in real life. I said; which sense keeps it to remember the dream after waking. He said; there is no way for sense. I said then you should know because senses are vain here that is the soul that God has put wisdom in it and it is a reason. He said; what I dream is like mirage one thinks it is water but when arrive at there is nothing. I said; how do you say it is like mirage and you ate sweets and pickles and were happy and sad he said; because what I dream when I arrive at it is nothing. I said: have you ever had sex in the dream and your hearts beat, have you ever had wet dream about a woman or man. You know him or don’t know He said many times said had you orgasm and when you woke up you were wet then this is not mirage.  
He said: dreaming orgasm is just like the real life .I said this is my reason that soul. Knows everything although senses are dead and can’t see or hear .of course you shouldn’t deny that soul in addition of the senses  does  the knowledge recognition in the waking life . after vanishing the senses has sex with them . it recognizes the things after going senses and now you understand that the soul  itself is guiding the senses and is their governor . none of the senses can do anything without soul; if the soul goes ahead , body can’t get back and if soul gets back the body won’t go ahead.   with the soul the happiness comes and with it the ache is received.  if a sense is damaged the soul is remained but if the soul is damaged  senses cannot  work properly.  


Dreams are good news or bad news about the near of far future happenings on the way.  
While sleeping part of the soul travels and understands something that is upcoming.It is said in a symbolic language that is translation of holy books symbols.In this way the holy books are said once more in our dreams to see what we will do in our life trials."

iro1tpa,AutoModerator,xzt5sr,"AutoModerator has been summoned to explain fake cryptocurrency site scams. Fake cryptocurrency websites and apps controlled by scammers are becoming more and more common. Sometimes the scam begins with a romance scammer who claims that they can help the victim invest in cryptocurrency. Victims are told to buy cryptocurrency of some kind using a legitimate cryptocurrency exchange, and then they are told to send their cryptocurrency to a website wallet address where it will be invested. Sometimes the scam begins with a notice that the victim won cryptocurrency on some website, in this case messages will often be sent through Discord. In either case, the scammer controls the website, so they make it look like there is money in the victim’s account on their website. Then the scammer (or the scammer pretending to be someone official who is associated with the website) tells the victim that they have to put more money into the website before they can get their money out of the website. Of course all of the money sent by the victim has gone directly into the scammer’s wallet, and any additional money sent by the victim to retrieve their money from the website will also go directly into the scammer’s wallet, and all of the information about money being held by the website was totally fake. This scam is also known as the pig butchering scam: https://www.reddit.com/r/Scams/comments/na8oax/asian_guygirl_from_online_dating_mentors_you_to/.

iq65u53,Mellow_Sunflower,xpw7gt,"They don't sound supportive in your interests, but also once you're an adult you're free to live your life however you want since their responsibility of you will be yours completely.

Time to grow up and stop asking your parents for permission to wear clothes."
iq66ewx,IndigoTrailsToo,xpw7gt,"It sounds like you don't feel supported by your parents and you feel very sad on the inside. It sounds like you desperately want them to support you and love you no matter what changes or things you try or what things you love. And you feel scared that their love is conditional, and that if you don't act the way that they want you to, that you won't get love. That is so hard. I am sorry.

I don't think that not hiding anymore is a good way to deal with this. It sounds like your parents truly aren't offering support unless you conform to the way that they want things. I am sorry. That is awful. It is truly awful.

There are some great videos on the YouTube channel called Cinema therapy that are aimed at Family relations and I think that some of them could be really helpful for you as you continue to process what you are feeling and how you feel let down. I don't have any specific suggestions for you, see if any of the family Dynamics movies that they talk about appeal to you and see if Jonathan and the things that he has to say can help you to feel better, and to help you feel more affirmed with what you are feeling and how you are not wrong, how you are not crazy. How about the one about the big house and the magical family?

I think that you have a lot of style and design going on inside of your head and that you seem like a very artsy person. Very creative. I think that this may continue to bloom and Blossom and start to play a part in your career or Hobbies as an adult. And I think that they are all wonderful things. There is a kid on the internet who reviews fast foods on YouTube in a full suit jacket. People don't say that he is dorky, they say that he is actually pretty cool. So you do you.

As you continue to grow up, I think that you may start to realize that you want to move out of that house sooner rather than later so that you can finally find a place of your own where you are accepted for who you are and what you want to do, no matter what you are wearing.

Also, I wanted to say that I did a bad thing here. I told you how you feel. That is bad. What do I know about how you feel? They are your feelings. So if you feel like you have gotten it wrong and I'm not right, you go ahead and say so. You let those feelings out!"

In a perfect world, you can set your parents down and talk to them about how you would like them to be more supportive.

 - I can make good money doing this hobby if I try. Show them some upscale work that other people have done and how much money they made. Show them cosplay and Custom Tailoring and unique outfits and other things that you potentially made you that the artist made a lot of money on."

iqapbbj,IndigoTrailsToo,xpw7gt,"Running a department store is a very different thing than doing clothing. A department store survives by margins and it is very much a business of accounting, making a profit off of the sales of the things that you have purchased. The best way to get started in the department store business is to get out there and apply for a department store near you. Work your way up to management and then keep working your way up from there.

But if you want to to clothing and design and tailoring, that is something very different. I think it falls into a couple different categories, it could fall into design, it could fall into fabrication, it could fall into fashion design, or it could fall into generally mending items. Think about what aspects appeal to you, and then try to find what communities and resources exist already. For example, if you are more interested in design, maybe you want to look at different types of design like graphic design and fabric design and so on and so forth. Try to find some magazines. If you are interested in fashion design, there are different reality TV shows about fashion design, there are magazines, websites, and start looking at the people who are trying to break in and the things that they are doing to get there, for example, their Instagram portfolios.

Adding on to what the others have said, it does seem like your parents are very unsupportive of who you want to be, what you want to dress like, and what career you want to go into. I think that it's much more likely that this divide continues to widen Until you realize the only way to be happy as a person is to move out and break off from their support and their finances and to be an independent person all by yourself. There is a chance that the family might heal through family therapy but things have been going on for so long and generally people don't want to stop being mean and biased and prejudicy and bossy."

Unless you have parented or cared for a child like this, don’t be so quick to judge. Most children at that age would not need that kind of restraint, but there are some with hidden disabilities for whom it is a life saving device."

Over a coat? When you were 16?  And not ""I need a warm winter coat,"" but ""I need a completely anachronistic formal garment or I'll kill myself""?

iqkbwg8,theoldkitbag,xsdshu,"* Kilts evolved from the *brat* way back in the 16th century, not the 1860's. The 'small' or 'walking' kilt (i.e. the one you know of) is, however, an almost exclusively Scottish item.  
* Every county having its own traditional shade/plaid/tartan pattern is an entirely invented affectation born out of Victorian England's fad for quaint-ifying all things 'Celtic'. Such practices were never in actual traditional use; it remains only as tourist fodder. Even so, these patterns were ascribed to Scottish clans, not Irish counties.     
* Irish people never adopted the walking kilt - or any kind of kilt - to 'show our heritage'; the Scots derived from the Irish (and Picts, and Norse), not the other way round. Their only limited use was/is in pipe bands, as part of the now-expected uniform of such bands. 
* While I won't say that *no* Irish shop sells kilts, I would say that's pretty close to the mark. Any you found online are probably just tourist traps. Kilts here would only be worn by Scots, or those trying too hard (and inaccurately) at a wedding or something."
iqk3l5a,IrishFlukey,xsdshu,"Irish people extremely rarely wear kilts, not like Scotsmen. It is a very rare thing. That is why there are so few shops. If you see someone wearing a kilt in Ireland, you usually assume that they are Scottish. They almost always are."

iqmwh7s,chapkachapka,xsdshu,"Irish traditional dress would be a leine, not a kilt. In modern Irish “leine” just means shirt, but the traditional Irish leine was a long garment covering the upper body and with a knee-length skirt below. Old illustrations of someone wearing a pleated or belted leine sometimes look like a skirt and a kilt, but it was actually a single garment.

The first use of kilts in Ireland started with the Gaelic Revival in the mid-to-late 19th century, basically as a way to distinguish Irish from English culture by copying another Celtic culture—basically they saw the Scots do it, they saw old illustrations of leintes that looked like kilts, and they assumed it must be a pan-Celtic custom that had been suppressed here.

These 19th century kilts would have been solid colours, blue, green, or saffron. The saffron kilts survive in some formal Irish military up uniforms, but kilt wearing never caught on with the general Irish public and kilts are basically unknown here now. You wouldn’t see people wearing them everyday or even at formal occasions, as is common in Scotland.

As for the “county tartans,” those were made up in 1996 to sell kilts to Irish-Americans. There’s absolutely no tradition or history of them in Ireland, and the only people who will tell you otherwise are trying to sell you a kilt.

Tl;dr, kilts in Ireland aren’t a tradition since the 1800s, they’re a fad from the 1800s and have no real history behind them. “Irish” tartans are just pretend. The saffron kilt is the only one that has any modern relevance, and even that has very little.

They are blessed to have you in their lives"
isy4i1c,Jennywrensong,y7x1at,"I will pray. Do you know how to have a relationship with Jesus, have your received His gift of salvation? When we know we make wrong choices, have wrong attitudes, and know we would rather please ourselves than God we can understand we need forgiveness and His gift of salvation. Knowing the scriptures will help us know what to do. Let's look -  

 1) the problem: Romans 3:10 and 23: As it is written: “There is no one righteous, not even one;  23, 24: for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, 24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 

2) the payment due: Romans  6:23  For the wages of sin is **death**, but the **gift** of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. (Death is physical and spiritual)  

3) God's great mercy: Romans 5:8 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this: While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.  (He took our place and our sin was in Him as He died on the cross.)  

4) Our part: Romans 10:13 Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. (when we know we have done wrong, and believe that Jesus is the only One who can save us, we can ask Him to come into our lives, take our sin away and give us new life. We also want to give Him control and be our good Shepherd.) 

Once you have been born into God's family (John 1:12  Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.) you can share that with your family. Being in a church that teaches the Bible, and reading it daily for yourself will help you grow to be more like Jesus and your family will want the joy, peace and assurance that you have.  I did that many years ago and my mom noticed such a change in me that she said if she hadn't known me before, she wouldn't know I was the same person!  I had great need for God to take over my life and change me, and He did and continues to work in and through me. He is so merciful and patient and He is our Good Shepherd.   

The enemy of our soul will try to get us to rely on ourselves, to try to please God in our own power, so these verses are great to memorize:  

Ephesians 2:8-10  For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9 not by works, so that no one can boast. 10 For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.  (Being in God's family is so amazing and He will guide us and use us even with all our imperfections.)"

25Then Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid, nor be dismayed; be strong and of good courage, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.”

26 Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

Jeremiah 32:17 

17 Ah Lord God! Behold, You have made the heavens and the earth by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm! Nothing is too difficult for You, 

Fight against fear, that’s a big enemy, and discouragement, and hopelessness in any capacity, give it to God.

Remember God needs you here, he has a purpose for you in this war. Like seriously I like to imagine the Jesus returning with his sword and wrath and just demolishing satan and his demons who cause the evil and suffering in this life.

He has plans for you and as hard as it is to face this life and world some days we must but not alone, never alone for God is always with us. I would say put a smile on your face, but that kinda like putting water through the drain and expecting it to fill up.

He very well could be using this so you do rely on him and learn him more

My suggestions? Pickup the Bible and study it if you don't already it will really, really help. Pray if you don't and tell him exactly what is going on.

irisocs,BVel228,xykqnp,Many guys in their late 30's and up who message much younger guys are trying to relive their youth. When they were that age they oftentimes didn't have much action for many different reasons. Now that they're older they feel that they missed out and need to have fun now before they get too old. This is why I recommend gay guys have their fun in their early and mid 20s so by the time they reach their late 30s or older they won't feel they missed out. And they won't be trying to constantly get with younger guys.

irkl0o2,Minimum-Departure,xyvx4d,">we provide and the usability to make it as easy as possible for the end artist to use.

I can say with absolute certainty that is not true. I have used actionvfx for years on all kinds of tv shows and actionvfx fire is the most difficult to use. I find because it is shot so underexposed it has the dynamic range but it takes more work to look like real fire instead of just gaining it up.

Also because the fire is shot slow motion the motion blur never looks natural when you speed it up and put fake blur on. It doesn't 100% match real fire.

Plus it's v less often  you work on slow motion shots so it is just an extra step

If every element had a correctly exposed full speed version and then a full range one that would be the easiest to use.

When I go through our element library at work I almost always use other elements and actionvfx is usually the go-to only because other elements don't exist.  


Some of the elements like the blood burst and the bullet hits need to be cg. There is no other way around it."

irm6pzp,Onemightymoose,xyvx4d,"That's a really great question! And something we're constantly trying to figure out. 😂

The first question would be: Who is your desired target audience?

If you're aiming for entry level artists, your technical focus could change to being more aimed towards really light files, etc. Because they're less concerned with things like bit depth of elements.

For the pro audience: it's hard to get around that files can be huge. We also offer the ability to allow artists to download on demand anytime they want, which is different from a single-link that expires method that a lot of people take.

And serving huge file downloads on the regular is crazy expensive, unfortunately!

So it's a hard thing to try and attack to see what's best."
irkn5rg,Onemightymoose,xyvx4d,"I appreciate the feedback! 🙏🏻

I will say that the majority of our users working in professional pipelines would prefer to have more control over their elements than less. Instead of having overexposed assets that already have varying shutter speeds across assets when filmed makes it harder to match a consistent result.

Depending on what you're editing in, there are some quick ways that can get you a really fast result for being closer to drag-and-drop, if that's what you're looking for.

Here's an example of one tutorial we offer that has some great techniques. https://youtu.be/Fga78PEHC2E

Reelsmart Motion Blur and Levels can generally get you pretty close to what you're looking for. It's definitely leagues better than something like Pixel Motion Blur in AE. 

https://revisionfx.com/products/rsmb/

We will definitely take the thoughts you shared into consideration when making future assets, and will continue to find any ways we can to meet your specific needs.

If you have anything that comes to mind we could also provide, I.E. a plugin or preset that does this for you, while it still allows for maximum flexibility for the existing studio artists. Or if there's anything else we can do to make your work easier, I'd love to chat more!"
irku73r,Minimum-Departure,xyvx4d,"I work in a professional pipeline. I find that more control leads to fire shots not matching because not everyone knows how to make them look good. I say this because I've worked on a firefighter TV for about 5 years and not everyone who has worked on this show has the experience I have.

I use reel smart motion blur and it was what I was referencing to. It doesn't look 100% the same and there is something about the other elements which look better.

i also did fire on helstrom and I found the same thing.

[https://www.fxelements.com/products/fire-pack-3](https://www.fxelements.com/products/fire-pack-3)

if you look at this pack whenever I use these on shows they look better than actionvfx in the limited use cases they work. The movement, the ignition, the randomness makes them look good. And the color is much easier to make them look correct.  


These elements have their own problems in that many of them are less than 150 frames so they don't work for longer shots."
iqtiyej,spinster-core,xu3dar,"I think it's a pretty universal thing for parents to take photos that their kids are mortified by. Your mom probably thinks you look beautiful no matter what, so she's probably not going to consider angles and lighting and all that like you would if a group of strangers asked you to take a pic of them.

Seeing photos my dad's taken of me pretty much always destroys me, then I see pictures he likes of himself and can't tell if he's just very confident or if he actually doesn't place nearly as much importance on his own looks as the average person does.

Your feelings are completely valid, but it absolutely sucks that you have to feel them. I hope someday you consider your nose just as ""good"" a nose as your brother's. Hang in there. You're not alone. 💛"

Regarding youth: there are some things you can do, such as exercising, putting on sunscreen, eating healthy, trying not to stress(practice meditation, gratitude) 

Good looks: while not all of us won the genetic lottery, you can try working out, eating healthy, working on your confidence and body image issues, dress nice.

Height: you can do expensive surgery to expand your height or you can wear secret insoles on your shoes that will increase your height by 5 centimeters, I used to do that in the past, and while it helped me, I couldn't wear sandals/flip flops or it's just felt like I'm faking so much, but up to you. 

Friends: in today's world, if you have one or two good honest, loving, caring friends it's like you won the lottery. There are a lot of fake friends or just regular friends without deep emotional connections. 

Exciting life: some are just wealthier, come from wealthier families, have their own business to work remotely, or just take loans from the bank, but many times people are faking it in social media and they are humans as well going through the same stuff an average person in your country goes as well. Facing fears, depression, and silent battles that people don't know about. 

In your free time try to study skills that are useful to our modern world and invest, make an additional income source,  always try to be a better version of yourself, and don't compare yourself to others( I do and it sucks) and move on your own pace, we people are different from each other.

But also being up to date on trends, and current events. Looking at clips of Seinfeld and Friends, and posting quotes, nostalgia, about how everyone finds the same joke funny etc.

I know being a 31 year old Black gay man, I grew up in social media as a millenal etc. Social media us a good people watching tool, at least for me. Lol.

It's 2022, maybe 20 years ago, social media was a small sliver of society. 

But unless you're 900 years old, or you're Amish or something, (which even then. Senior citizens and Menonites use technology now lol) everyone uses social media, and conforms to it.

is93swn,Ok-Ebb5496,y2pib0,"That's, something I can't unfortunately help you with. As a white guy, and specifically Mediterranean characteristics, I never had trouble with my borne features. However I do relate to some degree. 

I kinda hated my body. Now it will sound weird but, I hated my male characteristics. In all my life, I found women attractive, as such when I found out I prefer men, I tried dressing better to attract men. However I did so by trying to mimic women. Since that's what men ( straight men that is) found attractive. I quickly found out, I can't be smooth. I can't have the ass and hips of a woman. 

I realised if I tried to do something that I can't be, I would fall to despair. Obviously hrt isn't an option since, I am by the end a man. I just didn't , and well still, know how to be attractive, sex appeal, as a man. Media, apart toned men, never show the physical characteristics of a man. As such I grew up thinking that men need an athletic body to be physically attractive. 

After hook ups I had a realization. Men don't need to be fit, athletic, whatnot to be sexy. Almost all men I went with weren't fit.

As such I tried to shift my mindset. Essentially saying even normal guys are sexy. It has kinda worked out. Women still remain far more, visually impressive (even when I hard prefer men), the average woman being far more better looking than an average man. But at some point I should be able to change my mindset.

 Best of luck to you mate!"

And almost impossible to avoid social media in 2022, again unless your a geriatric person, or for religious reasons, don't use internet/social media (which even then as I said, old people and religious sect people, generations have changed, to where these categories of people, are up to date on the virtual world lol) everyone does, and will pay attention, and participate in social media. 

So I feel the incorrect answer is ""turn off the internet/social media"" Meh, well, if this were the 90s, maybe it would be easier to have, ""the internet is a lie"" lol, attitude. In 2022, and assuming OP like myself, is in a younger generation, and in their teenage years, social media was prevalent etc.. That's simply not happening, and social media/internet, is like water now. Especially for LGBTQ folks, to where we feel isolated/socially lacking irl as is, so social media can be beneficial for us. Etc. 

What I will agree on, is stay away from toxic groups, online communities, etc. But that's common sense, and saying ""get off the internet"", as a remedy to that, does not make. Lol. So yeah. Thank you."
is5l76e,PonderinLife,y2pib0,I hope s. ‘Cause I’ve seems everyone suggesting to work on myself. But I’ve seen some videos that say self-improvement is useless so IDk what to believe.
iqd0ik0,Intelligent_Many_582,xqwqke,"I did it. Grew up in church/ministry. Was active as an adult. Then? Publicly renounced Jesus Christ. 

I didn't believe in Him and accepted that. The bible, Christianity, Jesus...it was just foolishness to me. After that I began to search out world religions and even study the occult to discover ""truth"". 

On surface my life seemed great. Internally I was a mess. I genuinely felt alone in the universe and eventually spent every day wanting to die. 

...then I went into a church service one night and told Jesus, ""If you're real, tonight is the night you show me - or I'm never seeking you again. After this I walk away for good."" Next thing I know the speaker touches me and I lose all body function and enter this space of radiant light and a love that I can't even describe! I was introduced to His Holy Spirit that night....and from that moment on - I've never had a doubt in my mind. 

Shortly after, I was delivered from the spirit of suicide. My life has changed completely...knowing that God loves me - just as I am. And that He will transform me daily for His glory. He's more real than the skin on your bones. I had to KNOW that...

..that if I were to leave Him, that there was NO WHERE that I could go. He was the answer all along. And always will be.

So yea. That's what happened in my case."
iqbpfrn,HonestGodQuestions,xqwqke,"He never gives up on you, regardless."
iqbrnhj,Xoariana1,xqwqke,"I have the perfect analogy of why you shouldn’t give up on GOD 

Example exercising…when you exercise right and you’re like I’m not seeing any results I’m trying and trying but there is no change right but then your lifestyle is horrible you’re eating take out everyday or eating high calorie food. And you may say no I only ate once today I only had Kentucky but you don’t realize how high calorie Kentucky is. Same with sin you may say oh not this sin is small it’s really nothing but it could be the same thing messing you up. And then when it comes to exercising it takes time some people may see results that same day some it may take months but you still trust the process,and same with GOD, GOD comes at the right time not your time it make take weeks days months or more that’s why you just have to trust the process. And last but not least you’re saying I’m exercising everyday but I see no progress right? But you’re doing them 5 minute workouts everyday how do you expect results when you’re not even putting in the bare minimum. Same with GOD how can you expect a relationship if you don’t put in the effort….you’re praying for 5 minutes and you’re reading your Bible like once a month. 

All in all just like with exercising you don’t give up because you will see progress and it’s the same with GOD don’t give up because you will see progress.

Oh and p.s When I tell you I’ve been in something similar and when I tell you TRUST GOD, TRUST HIM I’ve been struggling with the same sin for years I couldn’t give it up if my life depended on it LITERALLY! I was the same about to give up but the LORD delivered me in the most random way ever. GOD will never leave you"
iqbsn6u,sickandtired679x4s,xqwqke,"Can I ask you a question? Are you following Jesus for you or because you realized what Jesus went through for you on the cross?
The reason I asked this is because, believing in God and being a christian has nothing to do with you, or me. 
It has everything yoy do with GOD sending His son to die on the cross, and drinking fron GODs cup of wrath the wrath meant for us so that we would not perish.

You can read your bible, and you can pray. But nothing will change until you are willing to surrender your life, your desires, your wants and dreams over to Jesus.

Now before you turn away to think ""oh thats what its about, I gotta give up everything because a guy died for me?"" 
Let me make this clear to you - All humans, every single one of us are looking for answers in this broken world. An answer that will make us feel fulfilled, happy, complete. 
The thing is Nothing, nothing in this world can make us feel this way. It will always be temporary and then you're back to searching again. 
Surrendering your life means acknowledging that GOD is in control and now you are willing to do His will instead of your own. 
Thing is GOD made you, and every human intimately knowing each one of us and how many hairs are on our heads. So only He knows what can make us feel fulfilled in life. And that is Him. He made us for Himself. 
So until you're ready to surrender all things to Him He's not going to answer you're questions. 

He wants whats best for you because He loves you, He made you, and He knows you; but you need to first surrender to Him. In that moment you become His child and now He can work with you.

We are made of clay, we are living souls living in a fleshly tent of clay, and our souls long for His holy light, but we cannot obtain it unless we are first blood bought washed in the holy blood of Jesus Christ. Then we are cleansed, made new, and adopted into His family. Through this He then begins molding us to love like He loves - sacrificially, care, compassion, forgiveness, mercy and yes hate what He hates which is sin. 
Now I want you to notice that I didn't mention that God will fill you up with happiness. Why? The answer is simple happiness is a fleeting moment. God doesn't want you to be happy fleetingly. He wants you to be filled with joy in the LORD that is why Philippians is one of the most joyful books despite Paul's circumstance of being in prison.
When God fills you up with the joy of Himself it will never leave you and it will never forsake you because it will always lead you back to Him who gives you all things that you need, not what you want.

Jesus says to count the cost because once you begin to follow Jesus you can't go back. And there are severe consequences to walking away, its also important to know what you are walking away from. You'll be walking away from life, breathe, joy, love, compassion, and holiness. Because GOD is all of these things. 
So when you walk away that is why hell is a place of fire, no oxygen, heat, weeping and gnashing because there is no oxygen, anguish and pain because there is no love (true love, not worldly love).

So, Id like to encourage you to seek getting to know GOD.
He hears you and you are always welcome to go to Him and cast your cares on Him but remember GOD is real, His Holy Spirit is the third person of the triune GOD, and Jesus the son is the second. They are three in one abiding in one another. A mystery and yet they are three distinct persons, with feelings. 
Jesus died for you to have a relationship with Him and the Father and the Holy Spirit. So it has to be a relationship not just all about you asking him to do things for you because he has things He has things He would like you to be a part of for His glory.

We read in Genesis that GOD the Father was grieved in His heart and regretted making man because their deeds were evil and their heart was continually evil all the time.
In John 11:34 we see Jesus wept, because of the death of lazarus and his family in mourning, and in the epistles Paul warns us that we should not grieve the Holy Spirit.

GOD doesnt need us, He never did, but He chose to create us for His own purposes and His own pleasure.
It will grieve Him for you to walk away. But He doesn't need you, His desire is for you to join in His plan to redeem mankind from sin. 
You need Him because He gave you life. And now He is offering life everlasting through His son. 
You can be patient and wait on the LORD and continue getting to know Him, or you can walk away. 
But dont mistake GOD for some magic genie who will fix your problems. He is GOD, and ultimately you make the decision to resist temptation, resist the devil so the enemy will flee. 
The more you practice resisting evil urges, the easier it gets and GOD will strengthen you. But you've got to make the first move. And never give up praying like the persistent widow.

May GOD bless you and keep you in Jesus' name. Amen."
iqbsbey,skeetsEdie,xqwqke,"When you are truly saved, you don't want to do some of the sinful things you did before for pleasure because the Holy Spirit dwells within you and guides you.  That said, the evil one is always there to tempt us when we are vulnerable and takes any chance he can to get us to sin.  If you haven't been baptized (I recommend by submersion but not necessary) I would do so to show outwardly you want to start a new life by cleansing your old self.  It is a good reminder to keep close to your heart why you made that choice to do it.  And messy life or not, it's for all of us.  We're all sinners in need of a Savior.  What are you expecting from your relationship with God?  My mantra is 
Obedience =Faithfulness"
iqbuu8t,redditbotnotbot,xqwqke,"What you are going through is impatience.

God is not giving you what you want when you want it so you're going to give up.

A lot of 'believers' have been here, and so have I at one point.

But you have to remember that God does things on his own time.

God will give you these blessings when the time is right for you to receive them.

If your faith would grow stronger for God because you received these blessings right now, then the time is not right for you to receive them.

God could be testing you to see if you're really in it for the long run.

iqbq8hk,ramen-in-a-pan,xqwqke,"Jesus came to free us from bondage and give us the choice. If you have not fully repented, looked to the cross, and asked God for mercy, you will remain in bondage.


God wishes for all to come to true sorrowly repentance, and He has decided to love all who look to His son and what was done at the cross.


You do have a choice. God has said that his Holy Spirit can help us overcome. This is also a choice. It's not easy because we naturally love sin. And we choose to ignore the outcome of our eternity and forget it exists for 10 minutes of porn. That's how ludicrous sin is. We exchange eternity for 10 minutes of porn. Then we choose to ignore God just to look at people who don't even care about us. We watch them do filthy acts and make money, while we sit there and continue to die with them.

But do turn back to face Jesus and see that He only wants to show you a life free of addictions and slavery to selfishness. There is a better life. Build your life on Jesus and cling to Him.

The Lord has freed me from my addiction. I used to watch it every night before bed. Now I go to bed with peace of mind."

itaauf5,BicyclingBro,ya9ny3,"Just in general, go with the attitude of just enjoying the atmosphere and music, dancing, and having a fun time. Don't have an underlying goal of hooking up or be constantly looking for that or it'll zap your ability to actually have fun and make you feel like the night was a failure if you don't meet someone.

Not to mention, in my experience, the best way to wind up meeting someone is actually to not try so hard, and just enjoy the night. People are attracted to people that look fun and happy, not people who look like they're fixated on finding a hookup."

The single guy from tinder, I wouldn't have relayed your worries. I'd of just said something along the lines of 'perfect, I was wanting to visit a good friend of mine that lives in that area soon anyway, ill just meet you there!'"
isfslw1,raeltireso96,y4pe9p,Your caution is warranted but to be honest many don't want to take all those extra steps. You arent doing anything wrong but your app experience seems so frustrating and there are so many other ways to meet guys in a giant city such as LA
isf9v2h,PonderinLife,y4pe9p,"Holy shit that’s a good line for the second guy. And even if I’m there for their enjoyment (which is fine by me) at least communicate with me ahead of time if you wanna change plans. Don’t let me go the entire week thinking I had something planned just for you to switch it up at the last minute and leave me hanging. That’s more of a maturity/communication red flag. We talked about this on Monday. So there was plenty of time to let me know if a change of plans. *That’s* what I’m irritated about. 

My thing is, I see a lot of gay guys talk about being lonely and how they can never get a BF, and then when someone actually does wanna meet up or try to connect they just flake out. You can’t get anywhere if you don’t commit to something."
isfa3gn,HeyItsThatGuy84,y4pe9p,"Totally man, I get the irritation for sure. Unfortunately they might not be the only ones that flake on you. SO many on the apps do that it's absurd. Sending good vibes tho, I know the struggle!"
isfadx6,PonderinLife,y4pe9p,Thanks man. I’m just gonna get a hair cut and focus on me today.
isdn7jq,workingtoward,y4btmt,"It’s odd because the point of meeting up some place is that if you don’t like each other, you can leave and you can’t do that if you come in the same car."
isdf116,gaygeek76,y4btmt,"I don’t want to comment on whether this is odd because I live in a city and people don’t drive to meet up here. 

That said, you are clearly uncomfortable with the arrangement, and you shouldn’t force yourself to do something you are uncomfortable with — even if every reply here tells you that it’s normal. Do only what you feel comfortable with. Explain your reasoning. See if he’s willing to change the plans. 

Good luck!"
isdaqpa,Puzzleheaded_Ring139,y4btmt,Not odd at all
isdakg7,13rahma,y4btmt,"Doesnt seem that odd to me if you're going to an area that has hard to find parking. If you thought it was odd, you should have suggested some where else."
isdf4ry,TinyViolinist,y4btmt,"He appears to be disinhibited regarding online meetups from what you said... When most people are wary when first meeting a person from online. 

I think it's unusual, but not necessarily cut him up and eat him unusual. 

If you feel you'd be more comfortable traveling in separate cars for the first date, I suggest saying so.

Takes away stress of traveling together when the date is over if it went badly."
isdq5vl,StatisticianSuper129,y4btmt,"Do not do it. That’s like dating 101 and a clear safety hazard. Never get in the car with some dude you’ve never met from a dating app. Do not listen to these people in this sub, it’s astounding how people have forgotten the rules of stranger dangers. Meet at a public location always and once you’ve gotten to know them, then you can consider that. Lots of people have wound up robbed or murdered by doing that so dont take that risk! 

(Ps Instagram isn’t real, there are plenty of times where I thought someone from IG would be cool, but in real life they were weird or just complete assholes)"
isds181,SameSteak738,y4btmt,People do this a lot in big cities like Miami and LA. It makes no sense but it’s not a red flag.
isgbxw2,RoninRM,y4btmt,Meet up at Starbucks!  They all have plenty of parking!
isdohmg,PonderinLife,y4btmt,This. Very much this. And he’s 5 years older than me.
isdlszx,PonderinLife,y4btmt,"Well see I live in LA (but I’m from the east coast). So I’m not a stranger to being in a city. But also, it does seem a little odd though. Especially for the first time we’re meeting up."
isdb4mg,PonderinLife,y4btmt,Ok so it’s just me being weird then.
isdb3ea,PonderinLife,y4btmt,I’m new to the area so IDK many places to meet up.
isdm38o,PonderinLife,y4btmt,"Yeah to me it seems a tad odd. Especially if it goes badly, or I’m just not interested, I have to drive him back or he has to drive me back. Or say he doesn’t wanna drive me back. Then I’m just stuck. It seems odd. Plus he’s already a good 30 minutes away."
isdxugp,PonderinLife,y4btmt,"Now see, this is what I was thinking. ‘Cause he already lives 30 minutes away from me. Like, I get that we’re in LA. So parking is going to be scarce wherever you go. But to get in his car (or have him in mine) for an extended period of time *as a first time meeting* is a little odd. Maybe the 3rd or 4th sure. But, I don’t know this guy. 

And it just feels weird. ‘Cause say if something does go wrong, I’ve gotta depend on him to drive me back. Or have him in my car on the way back. And that’s something I just don’t want for the first time."
isdxl4r,PonderinLife,y4btmt,But maybe it should be though
ise0uq6,Jmcb23,y4btmt,What does that have to do with anything? If you're weirded out by the age gap then why are you bothering to meet?
isdyay6,SameSteak738,y4btmt,A little careless maybe. It doesn’t mean the person is a creeper or murderer though. Remember that most dudes bring complete strangers to their house.
isdyp29,PonderinLife,y4btmt,"Yes. But something about this feels odd though. Like, an extended period of time in his car. We’re already meeting for brunch."
isdz003,SameSteak738,y4btmt,"At the end of the day the important thing is that you feel comfortable with the arrangement. I would feel comfortable picking someone up after talking for a few weeks, but I’m not you. Just be honest and tell him you much rather meet there."
ise05h2,PonderinLife,y4btmt,"The few weeks we’ve talked have been sparse. Like, we haven’t talked everyday. There was a whole week where I didn’t even hear from him. Actually now that I think about it, it’s really only been 2 weeks counting today. So not even that long."
ireqmd4,Don-tLetItBringUDown,xy0kvs,"Every time I dream about dick it has the ability to grow longer if you pull on it, and then I can reel it back in to normal size. 
9 times out of 10, these dreams are about me wanting to easily suck my own dick."
iqbs1wf,Der_Missionar,xqwgda,"Yes, you have to choose...."
iqbpbuh,StarWarsChristian,xqwgda,"Yeah it can happen. One big issue is we get so eaten up with guilt for our sin that we forget that God's grace is bigger. Sometimes I wonder why God would want someone like me in Heaven. But God loves us and wants to show us a better way. In those times you feel too dirty to pick up the bible do it anyway. Why would you let the enemy win? The devil wants you to feel unworthy and unloved in the hopes you will fall away. Don't do that. Let God help you turn away from your sin and show you His love. Look at how He treated the woman caught in adultry. Everyone has sin. But God loves us so much He sent Jesus to pay the price for that sin.

When I first became a christian I wanted to hold onto worldly things and still sin against God. I made a major mistake. But He was still there and He gave me the strength, courage, and humility to work through it and get to a much better place. Glory goes to Him!! I had to make a choice which side I was going to be on and I chose Jesus. And I had to make some big changes. 

You are feeling convicted for a reason. Don't let the guilt eat you up, make some tough choices and pick a side. I have never regretted picking Jesus. But that doesn't mean I'm sinless either. I can recognize my sins and try my best to avoid them better."
iqc39q1,PerfectlyCalmDude,xqwgda,"Most people can understandably feel that way, lust is strong."
iqc53b2,Wonderful-Article126,xqwgda,"You do indeed have to choose between Jesus or your sin. Everyone does. 

If you are willing to make that choice then Jesus will cleanse and heal you by His blood. 

If you aren’t willing to submit to God’s ways and truth then no amount of external efforts is going to wash away your sin and restore relationship with God."
iqbpx1y,elpis3,xqwgda,"You mean, choose Jesus or continue to live in sin?

And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed. But he who does the truth comes to the light, that his deeds may be clearly seen, that they have been done in God.”
John 3:19‭-‬21 NKJV

My question is, are you saved?"
iqc0ukw,Adventurous-Tie-5772,xqwgda,"You feel like you have to choose because they told you to?

Your sexuality has nothing to do with this unless you are using your sexuality to harm people. 

God is love and you cannot help who you love. Love is of the Spirit and you do not have to choose between who you love and God unless that particular person that you love does not have love."
iqbtufx,,xqwgda,"Just remember Peter, who denied Christ three times. Jesus approached him with grace afterwards. We will never be too unclean for God. Christ died for us when we were completely covered in filth. God still disciplines us for our sin, but never leaves us."
iqcy8dm,jakoooon,xqwgda,"I'm sorry you've been made to feel this way by people. 

Isaiah 56:4-5 to the eunuchs who observe my Sabbaths, to them I will give, within my walls a memorial and a name, I will give them an inheritance greater than sons or daughters. 

Eunuchs we're shut out of temple worship bc of gender and sexuality reasons, yet God is promising them a place and an inheritance in the Kingdom. The Bible IS clear, God has made space for you in the Kingdom and you will receive an inheritance."
iqdkb9s,LiebeIstFurAlleDa88,xqwgda,"I read that a long time ago when the Bible wasn't mass available, teachers wouldn't let their students read the Bible until they were sufficiently purified of all sin. Because otherwise the teachers feared the students wouldn't understand the Bible. Sounds similar to what you're experiencing, maybe try going through some time of prayer and fasting to get the demons out of you, then when you are close with God try and read."
iqdl10c,fleshnbloodhuman,xqwgda,Well.. that’s just one on a list of many.
iqdrasw,Nintendad47,xqwgda,"Jesus is the preacher of hard choices...listen to these...

And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, ‘where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.’
Mark 9:43‭, ‬45‭, ‬47‭-‬48 ESV

So it isn't easy to die to yourself and follow Jesus.  It better to deny you sexual urges knowing that in the resurrection you will have a perfect body that will suffer no more."
iqelvtm,saltysaltycracker,xqwgda,Please don’t make you sexuality your identity. I think that’s the problem. You have put some part of you ahead of who God says you are. Focus on Jesus. Focus on His grace and love and understand you have been reconciled. Live out of that rather than thinking your sexuality makes your identity
iqhlfpq,Fixlzalud,xqwgda,"Tbh - i dont think you have to choose.. 

i have the same problem - not regarding sexuality but life choices in general - i felt like absolute shit when i was “doing the right things” like reading the bible and what not

i think it is up to yourself in a way to find rhytmus od grade and to find this life jesus said that it is life to irs fullest 

yes bible community church etc are helpful in many regards - but its strengths are at the same time its weakness and i think saying STOP from time to time is helpful - also focusing on just being with people and not having thoughts in the back of your head can be practiced and i find it does help to calm down

i went to 3 years of bible school so i think i know a thing or 2 

i hope you get to a point where you and I and all of us can see ourselves the way He sees us 
in the meantime - i hope you find peace"
iqs1zwf,ActualPegasus,xqwgda,What is your sexuality?
iqc2rja,sickandtired679x4s,xqwgda,"Best answer unfortunately, I'm sorry about your situation Op, however the truth is Jesus said to deny thyself pick up thy cross and follow Him.

We all have to learn to deny ourselves one way or another. For myself it's my selfishness, and desire to be wanted be included or special or right all the time. 
I have to humble myself daily and im learning to ask if what im about to do or say filtered through the fruit of the Spirit - is it caring, is it compassionate l, loving, and most of all is it truth standing in GODs truth not my own.

Denying ones self means to stop giving into your feelings because your feelings lie. 1 minute you're happy next minute you're angry the next minute you're sad you can go through  hundreds of emotions and feelings in one day.

This world is built on the brokenness of sin based off of our feelings and what we think is right. Coming into a relationship with Jesus Christ and with God is willing to put aside those feelings and practice every single day asking God for his grace his mercy and his strength and his wisdom and understanding to help you to deny those feelings that lie to you and to stand on the truth.
And the truth is GODs word.
That man and woman were made for one another with a family unit in mind. That GOD is the head of that family, then the man. And that without GOD life falls apart and there is only death. 
So yes OP you have to make a choice. And i can tell you from personal experience that choosing GOD and learning to deny ones self is the best choice one can make. It saves alot of heart ache, you no longer flop around in emotions, standing on the truth will deliver you from depression, laziness, bad relationships and bad choices because you are now no longer looking to yourself for answers. Instead you're leaning on the one who knows all the right answers and He holds you up right and becomes your strength in all the hard times. 
He is trustworthy. Your feelings never will be.
But the choice is ultimately yours to make."
iqc24oc,PonderinLife,xqwgda,"But I feel like I’ll never experience like, a relationship or intimacy if I choose. But I would like to grow as a Christian."
iqc2ue0,sickandtired679x4s,xqwgda,Amen
iqc3xj5,PonderinLife,xqwgda,"I think the real motivation behind that is intimacy. Like, not so much even the sec aspect, but like………………the physical affection and the trust that would come with that type of relationship. I think that’s the real driving factor ‘cause I feel like I’ll never get that."
iqd63gd,PonderinLife,xqwgda,Yes J am saved and have been baptized.
iqc1o1z,PonderinLife,xqwgda,"I’m not using it to harm anyone. But I also know that being bisexual isn’t what God calls for people. 

But it also sucks because I feel like I won’t ever have intimacy, or a partner that I can share with. Like, that 1 special person. Or that I’m not deserving of it. Overall I just hate my sexuality, even though I can’t escape it."
ipqsr59,suncreamed,xmzfjs,A lot of guys on Grindr are just fishing for nudes and don't actually want to meet up with anyone. There's also the possibility that you're just not their type and they think ghosting might be easier than just saying that
ipr5jur,raeltireso96,xmzfjs,"They jerked off, came, and lost interest."
ipqwa1n,chikitoperopicosito,xmzfjs,"Either they’re fishing for nudes or you’re actually not attractive outside your cock/body. 

There are a lot of hot bodies on grindr. A lot of profiles look good but never show face and most of the time, when I message them cause I like their bodies and they send face, they’re ugly as fuck so I ghost them. 

What am I supposed to do? “Sorry man, messaged you because you have a hot body but your face is ugly.”"
ipqvg0o,Resolve-Equivalent,xmzfjs,"Number one by far Grindr mistake is assuming some rationality in interactions.  It’s not rational and rude or irrational responses or behavior are the coin of the realm on Grndr.   Let it go and move on, you’ll eventually connect"
ipr5290,LeDinosaur,xmzfjs,Hmmm. Need to see the ‘hung’ cock to evaluate
ipqsjh2,BillieShay,xmzfjs,"Perhaps rephrase your question to them: “Hey, you want a piece of my giant piece of meat?” Can be a bit intimidating"
ipqslff,ConsistentNoise2668,xmzfjs,They are telling the truth as in “you are hung” the reason the ghost is they are not interested in your hung cock
ipszskw,FightingLama,xmzfjs,"Ghosting on the apps is more common than actually meeting up IMHO. I think some people just want the build up. Not sure why, because it feels ultimately frustrating to me. Just realize it happens to everyone. Don't take it personally. I get the frustration though. You feel you hit it off with someone and get excited to meet up then get disappointed. 

Are you located in a bigger city? You might have better luck going to bars or other places to meet people in person."
ipr6zad,PonderinLife,xmzfjs,This. I think this. I’m just trying to meet a guy. Why is it so hard to find someone these days?
ipqwlc8,PonderinLife,xmzfjs,"Thing is, dude tells me I’m handsome too. I usually get “You’re handsome man” or “Damn you’re cute.” And they still ghost. So then what??"
ipr8uso,odanobux123,xmzfjs,Yeah sometimes guys will open with their cock pic and I don't find them attractive so I just tell em nice cock and leave it at that.
iptvypz,jaded_jamba,xmzfjs,Lmao and this is why most gay men stay single from birth to death. You are being honest though!
ipqu9b2,PonderinLife,xmzfjs,"Dude sent a picture of his ass after he said I was hung. I asked if he was free, then he ghosted."
ipt1szq,PonderinLife,xmzfjs,"Yes. I’m located LA. I find it so strange because me and this guy agreed to meet up tonight at 8 PM. We both agreed to meet at his place. He says he wants to take my virginity. I’m fine with that. So I’m like “cool see you at 8, what’s your address?” Radio silence. 

Why send me 13 asspics and tell me you wanna have sex with me just to ghost when I actually put my money where my mouth is? The men here are really difficult. However after this guy ghosted me I met up with a cute Spaniard who deepthroated me and thanked me afterward. Why can’t American men just be straight forward like that?"
iprazws,raeltireso96,xmzfjs,"Theres better ways than apps. I already told them to you tho. Be well man, best wishes."
ipqwqd5,chikitoperopicosito,xmzfjs,In that case. They probably only wanna collect your nudes. They’re probably catfishes that know they don’t have a chance with you.
ipt2n5n,FightingLama,xmzfjs,I have a good friend who lives there and he experiences the same thing. That happened to me a lot too when I was on the apps. I got rid of them in the spring and frankly I'm better off. Sounds like you should keep meeting up with the cute Spaniard and see how things progress. He might be a reason to get off the apps 😀
ipsps15,Trevonhaywood,xmzfjs,They could also be intimidated as well
ipqx1nx,PonderinLife,xmzfjs,"Honestly, knowing that it’s LA. I could see that."
itet249,nerdmonastery,yb5dxy,"My situation is different and I also live in a different country but I do empathise with the feeling of nobody wanting you.

I'm in my mid 30's and still never been on a date and am also a virgin still, although I can't really complain since I gave up on trying a while back now.

Besides working full time I just use whatever random hobbies I can to distract myself (usually gaming or going for walks lol).

It's probably not a great solution, but it's something you can do in the interim of trying to find the right guy.
Kind of like parts in equal measure; don't put all your focus on finding a guy, use some of that time to just learn ways to enjoy being in your own and/or hobbies you enjoy.

I guess hopefully at some stage the right guy will cross your path somehow."
itf11ls,sadgayaccount,yb5dxy,"If you look like a model, the only difficulties you face are the ones you choose. Are you only willing to go out with 10s?"

That's what it is. The fucked up part, I'd only Black guys/POC, can relate. I understand, absolutely. As a black guy myself OP. I'm single and lonely. Sad Black is a curse in this community. Cheer up OP. It will get better. Much Love to you OP. :)"
itfrd09,Semi-wfi-1040,yb5dxy,"In my twenties I suppose I was considered a cute guy , everyone wanted me and I was always attracted to the older guy and they were attracted to me , I had my pick , at 33yrs I met a guy fell in love and thought this would last forever, but it didn’t he left after ten years for a you guessed it a cute guy in his twenties, by then 43 yrs the youthful looks gone the older guys I was always attracted to still looking for the young guys , I felt washed up alone and the felling that nobody wants you I can relate to , fortunately I’m introverted so being alone never bothers me , but it would be nice to a least have a FWB relationship, but I’m not sure how to make that happen."
iter6br,nzdennis,yb5dxy,"It's just a feeling, feelings aren't permanent. Find an interest other than men"
itfe38p,Briefboyy,yb5dxy,"I really feel this. I get hit up on grindr a lot for sex. I’m a half asian 25m so I get really uncomfortable with the fetishization. Many white gay guys forget that they can be racist too for some reason 🙃 

I have a good enough body, try to use the apps, and I just want a boyfriend, but I’ve never gotten guys who want anything more than a hook up/fwb but that’s just not what I want. I think being in LA is hard. Lot’s of guys are pretty vapid here, but honestly just keep trying and working on yourself. Get involved in LGBTQ spheres and make it known you want someone for you! I could be totally wrong since I’m still figuring it out myself. Your mid-20’s suck so much from what I’ve heard since this is the age we are out of college, on our own, and have to be so independent. Good luck out there! :)"
itglyoq,PyreOfDeath97,yb5dxy,"When it comes to Grindr the people there are super fickle (I think because theyre messaging people too so there’s always some closer, who can host etc), so when it comes to hooking up I get as straight to the point as possible i.e hi, how are you, pics, what are you looking for, where, then bam. Granted this isn’t very safe but I’m generally good at sussing out catfishes. 

When it comes to meeting people in person, I can only relay my experience when I finally decided to actually get in the game. I went to a very famous gay club in London with some friends, and it was awesome. I think I got with 7 or 8 people that night. I’ve gone back every week to the point I can now go alone and will definitely find some friend I made in the club. From that level of exposure taking it to a relationship becomes a matter of ‘who do you like’ rather than ‘where is everyone.’

I too was signed to a modelling agency during uni and I get ghosted plenty on the app. Being a twink top is kind of a hard sell when everyone in my area is like a mid 30s top as well"
itf2crm,PonderinLife,yb5dxy,No. Usually these are the guys who approach me first. They jump in my DM’s. I send a facepic and they ghost or block me. So I’m pretty open to who and what comes my way.
itgmubl,PonderinLife,yb5dxy,"It’s weird because it’s all these white guys and Latino guys hitting me up. And “black” is clearly stated in my profile. So if they don’t like black guys, why the hell are they messaging one?"
itgngca,PonderinLife,yb5dxy,"Yeah I’m thinking of just focusing on building myself up. ‘Cause it seems men love to waste my time, or get my hopes up."
iterqp9,PonderinLife,yb5dxy,"See that’s the weird thing. I’ve got a small following of 40.2K on TikTok from my singing/music. And I’m in the process of writing up some courses I can sell to make more $$$$$. For some reason, I’m just hyper-fixated on men, sex, and having a relationship."
itffjmz,stillscottish1,yb5dxy,"In a White City, as an Asian man, the White Gays usually won’t want a relationship with you"
itfj409,PonderinLife,yb5dxy,"Just because we have to be independent, doesn’t meant we have to be immature about every person we come into contact with. Maybe it’s ‘cause I’m black and not the hyper masculine, thuggish stereotype black? 

But yeah, guys are pretty vapid here for sure. I’m from the south, so it’s not the first time white men have been racist to me. Lol. But they’re so different about it here. There’s a pettiness to it all. Everyone always saying “Yeah I’m free on the weekend.” And then completely ghosting you on the weekends. It’s like the men here like to be flaky. 

But yeah I’m just gonna try and build myself up and work on myself. ‘Cause damnit if nobody else in this town wants me, I’m just gonna have to want myself as weird as that seems. Easier said than done."
itgn8tu,PonderinLife,yb5dxy,"This sort. Being a twink top is so fucking hard. It’s weird, ‘cause I get other tops messaging me. And I’m like, you see the word “top” clearly stated in my profile. Just ‘cause I’m 5’6 and skinny doesn’t mean I’m gonna bend over for you."
itf2omb,sadgayaccount,yb5dxy,"Interesting. Like they DM you on Instagram or something? If you're model hot, maybe it's only the fellow hotties with lots of options who are hitting you up. I certainly wouldn't DM a hot model and try to get him to hook up with me. Try messaging one of us uggos. :p"

Tried getting with Latin guys and they blocked me too. It kinda does make me think that if I were another race (something with lighter skin) I’d probably be in a relationship by now. Which is so weird."
itffxwb,Briefboyy,yb5dxy,Yeah it sucks. White dudes don’t realize how much fetishization we go through. I had one white friend tell me how jealous he is of it and that I hit the “genetic lottery” for being a skinny asian guy. I was really offended by that hearing a white dude tell me I had more privilege than him. Dating is hard…
itgpkze,PyreOfDeath97,yb5dxy,"And on top of that I’m into other twinks, but they’re mostly looking for someone more masculine. Porn is not an accurate depiction of real life lol"

itf9osh,mrthreeoh5ive,y3j0gv,How are you a male model at only 5’6?
it4zk2p,Witterjay,y3j0gv,Yes
it50hxo,PonderinLife,y3j0gv,How???
itfbt78,PonderinLife,y3j0gv,"A lot of the modeling I did was print work (where there wasn’t a height requirement). Modeling isn’t just all runway stuff. Lol. Trust me, if I could he born 6’2, I would. Lol."
it50pmc,Witterjay,y3j0gv,You mind is your own worst enemy. What people think of you is never shown correctly...
it50uo7,Witterjay,y3j0gv,And no I'm not gay just looking at your profile
it523ld,Witterjay,y3j0gv,I've seen a 5'6 nerd(rip) but pull a dime because he's a nerd and new some shit. Confedence is the key in all forms just say you deserve this and do it
it52gh5,Witterjay,y3j0gv,I went into highschool at 5'0 pulled every top 3 looking girl in school and I'm a legend where I'm from from and that's not my opinion
is8tr9m,BillieShay,y3ifh6, Probably
is9mr7r,Many-Concentrate-491,y3ifh6,"You need to say you’re busy. 

That’s when guys will strike"
irnlc1w,Pristine-Butterfly68,xzqkbd,"Honestly my trainer I met the same way and he’s been amazing. Don’t go into it expecting to sleep with him as most trainers just need clients , cheers"
iro5bes,Strange_Chicken5991,xzqkbd,A good trainer knows where your points of instability are and will build you from there. Be sure they know how to work with you and for you. Rather than them applying their workout routine onto you. There’s a difference and don’t be afraid to say it ain’t working.
irnld9j,SuspiciousPine,xzqkbd,"Haha I don't think this is a common thing, but hey if he seems cool then go for it"
irnle68,Cersei1341,xzqkbd,"45 sounds a lot, was there extra benefits included 🤣🤣"
irnnriy,jayinatl,xzqkbd,"one issue here is if you are at a commercial gym then your gym probably doesnt allow outside independent trainers and if so you will have to act sly and could get kicked out for violating rules.

ask him what certifications he has.  he should have at a minimum a personal training certification from a well known legitimate organization.  you want to ensure he is actually qualified to do the job and is trained."
irnp5jp,RubberDuckyUthe1,xzqkbd,"I’ve meet a few trainers for “interviews” on Grindr. Completely non sexual, but they weren’t a fit for what I needed. Otherwise, great guys. Friendly, knew their stuff when it came to fitness but weren’t knowledgeable about bodybuilding."
irnvwea,scottnaz,xzqkbd,Depends on what you are training
irnx1ix,thrwAwaydogo232,xzqkbd,"Idk, lots of trainers advertise on insta or online.  Even for me, I thought about being a trainer but the 3 people I was tutoring under to learn let me know lots of people will try to bang them.  Lol you go hoping to be a trainer and just get a lot of pervs hoping to get laid"
irobmaw,jeremiah016,xzqkbd,"Me personally I wouldn't find a trainer that way,  yes they can understand me to a certain point but they aren't up front with what they want and it feels like your paying for eyecandy. I mean it works but Pts can get expensive and I dont want to waste time  with eye candy when I can get gains."
irq1gnx,SameSteak738,xzqkbd,I wouldn’t meet a trainer from Grindr. It’s important that the trainer is certified and ensured. The wrong type of training can give you life-long injuries and the cost is yours. There should be a contract and goals set. He might be legit but the risk is not worth it to me.
irribpp,,xzqkbd,[deleted]
irnm4gu,PonderinLife,xzqkbd,"Oh no I have no plans on sleeping with him. I just want the gains. I have a post of my goal body compared to where I am now. I showed him the same pics, and he was like “We can work with that.” So, I’m totally focused on the gains. And he doesn’t seem to be one for nonsense. He was like “You better be willing and able to meet the expectations.” So, there will be no room for that. Lol."
iro84kz,PonderinLife,xzqkbd,Ok. I see what you mean. What do think of buying workout courses from guys like Jeff Nippard or Kevin Hejnas?
irnooe3,RubberDuckyUthe1,xzqkbd,"That’s a good deal for a personal 1 on 1 training session. 

And no that’s not sexual innuendo."
irnm99g,PonderinLife,xzqkbd,"The only benefits I’m getting are the gains. Lol. He seems to be one who doesn’t tolerate BS, so I’m just here for the gains."
irnwa7d,PonderinLife,xzqkbd,The whole body. Lol. I wanna be one of those ripped/shredded InstaGays. Lol.
iro0p27,PonderinLife,xzqkbd,Yeah I’m not trying to get laid. I just want the type of body I can flaunt on social media. That’s really it.
iroec8a,PonderinLife,xzqkbd,"Yeah I’m trying to get gains, and *be* the eyecandy. Not pay for it. Lol. But yeah I see what you mean."
irq231x,PonderinLife,xzqkbd,Ok now this is a good point.
irrpiqa,PonderinLife,xzqkbd,"Honestly, the more I think about it, the less I’m open to it. He’s hot, but after listening to some of these comments. I think it’d be best to just get an actual licensed trainer and a nutrition program."
iqzgmch,_V_A_Y_,xv6sii,"Personally I think it does come across in subtle, almost unnoticeable, ways that we subconsciously pickup on."
iqzft2f,wscholermann,xv6sii,"Despite a lot of people saying nonsense to the contrary, if you're hot a lot people are still going to want you whether you ""love yourself"" or otherwise.  That's the plain, cold hard truth."
iqzgjjq,RoyalOrchidDude,xv6sii,"Shoot bro, I’ve been reading your posts, message me if you want. We should talk. Much love from this end. But to answer your question, if the person is attentive to body language, style of communication, etc. yes we can tell when someone doesn’t love themselves."
iqzifdi,LurkeyTheLurker123,xv6sii,"I'm quite similar to you: workout every week and always try my best to look good, depsite hating myself, due to the many deeply ingrained insecurities I've had since I was a child. 

Most people I've met cannot catch how much I hate myself, though I'm not sure whether that's due to a lack of emotional intelligence, my ability to put up a facade to fool people around me. 

But In a very few instances, people have seen right through me. One particular experience that stands out is when I was working at university as a steward. Happened to bump into a PhD professor who specialised in human emotions (the actual areas of research he was in had different names, just can't remember them)

After a few mins of just chatting and him asking me questions, he psychoanalyed me, pointing out his observations of my mental state based on my behaviour (body language, tone of voice, the way I responded to his questions). 

He said I had some deep insecurities I had trouble tackling, I was kind natured caring more about others around me than myself and even said I desired a strong partner who could physically take care of me. Everything he said was spot on. I was both shocked and extremely impressed he got all the information on me just based on my behaviour. The last statement stood out to me in particular, because although I didn't say anything abouty sexuality, I think he knew I was gay too. 

So do I think people can see you don't love yourself? Yes. Some people can if they are emotionally intelligent enough to spot the signs. It's not just about physical presentation: body language, behaviour, tone of voice, vocabulary usage, eye contact and many other factors are subtle, but deceptively accurate indicators of someone's inner self. 

That if you're with someone long term, they are increasingly more likely to notice your lack of self love, as they'll get to know you better overtime. So make sure you're willing to work on yourself before jumping into a serious relationship."
ir3pu2s,jeffers8,xv6sii,"I don’t understand the modern thinking that personal appearance equates to “loving yourself.” I think there are slobs who love themselves plenty and well-put-together, fit people with deep insecurities. It’s something you have to know the person to judge for yourself."
iqzitfv,Beneficial-Access714,xv6sii,I can never really tell if i love myself honestly. I really think i do. I hype myself up all the time and i get myself out of bed in the morning. I may not like my job but i get up and i handle it like i own it. I dont like alot of things in my life but to me thats part of my life. So im learning to love that so can get passed it.
ir0d7u3,raeltireso96,xv6sii,"Yes. We definitely can tell once we meet in person. 

That said, plenty of self-haters seem to get into relationships. Are they good ones? Probably not."
ir1x35a,maxpersa,xv6sii,"Yes i used to hate myself so I started to go to gym every day and buy alot of new clothes and work two job just save for a  house
The more I try the more people will tell me wow you hate yourself men. Oh look he trying to be the perfect bf  but I was just trying to build some one I will love"
iqzh86p,PonderinLife,xv6sii,Really? ‘Cause I’ve never noticed if someone doesn’t love themselves.
iqzg7t1,PonderinLife,xv6sii,"See a lot of people have tons me I’m hot. But they’ve also told me that I don’t love myself (which is true I’ll be honest about it) and that other people can tell. And I’m like, I’d that something people can really pick up on?"
ir0k152,PonderinLife,xv6sii,"Honestly, I gave up on love at 19. So there won’t be a relationship for me any time soon. Plus whenever I do try and meet up with a guy, they usually ghost or lose interest. So, I might as well just focus on my career and getting my face/body right."
ir0jkld,PonderinLife,xv6sii,But they still get into relationships.
iqzgdvo,wscholermann,xv6sii,If they think you're hot they will still want to fuck and date you whether you love yourself or not.  So I question the relevance either way.
ir1xkn4,maxpersa,xv6sii,Don't give up you will never know
ir0l0s4,raeltireso96,xv6sii,Yep. They should still make an effort to get healthy so they have healthy relationships but if everyone did that on their own the therapy industry would collapse lol.
iqzh6nj,PonderinLife,xv6sii,See I thought it was just me at first.
ir0m32s,PonderinLife,xv6sii,"Honestly, at this point, what’s the point of going to therapy. ‘Cause it’s clear I’ve got no one interested in me. Every guy I talk to either leaves early, or they ghost. Or they’re from another country and leave tomorrow. I’m convinced if I wasn’t in America, I’d probably be married by now."
ir0ni2p,raeltireso96,xv6sii,"What is with some black people and their refusal for self-improvement of their mental health? Im black and went to therapy and still go when the need arises. That's the point of therapy. But so many of our people refuse to do it and then wonder why they can't manage their mental illnesses. Therapy is way better than our reliance on the christian plantation but you do what you want. 

To the point, yes, people very much can tell if you have low self esteem. Body language works on the subconscious level for most of us and we don't often actively know when we're sending off signals or receiving them. Our brains are always on and always receiving an immense amount of data. If every guy ghosts or leaves early, then they sense something even subconsciously is off so maybe make some effort to fix that."
ir0oiku,PonderinLife,xv6sii,"Not that I don’t wanna go to therapy, but money is tight AF. I know I need therapy, it’s the money part that’s kinda holding me back right now. I’m just tired of feeling I’m unloveable and ugly AF. 

Like, I get the feeling things would be better if I was white."
itba7kq,VastDragonfruit847,yahcxh,"Naawww, one okay-ish experience is too soon to just sail the ship on gay clubs. Statistically speaking, nothing ever happens on the ""first's"" as your ""best's"" would take a little more than tha, don't you think?"
itbchm0,lo-finate,yahcxh,"Yeah you can absolutely go alone. But the times 8 did go in my ahem, younger days, it was always with a friend or two. Made it much more bearable."
itbxpau,throwawaylj89,yahcxh,Don’t let one slightly bad experience deter you from ever going again. Yeah going with friends makes a whole world of difference! Find some gay friends and go again. Gay clubbing can be the most fun!
itffmbd,stillscottish1,yahcxh,You should join Meet-up groups
itbywj4,PonderinLife,yahcxh,"I see what you’re saying. I just felt like a teenager in the club compared to everyone else who was so……….adult, if that’s the right word. I just felt oddly out of place. Like just walking up to the clubs I was like “I am out of my element”. At least I got out my comfort zone. I went to the clubs, and I approached a dude. So, at least it was something different."
itbrvje,hhhhhhhhmm,yahcxh,"I’ve never gone to such hips places as these, and a little too old to at this point. But I think things have changed. The gay bars I’ve been into there will only be a guy or two that came by themselves. It’s all friend groups, it’s a huge and not fun challenge going by yourself."
itbypgi,PonderinLife,yahcxh,I feel like I’d need to upgrade myself to go again. Lol. Everyone seemed so adult. I felt like I looked like a teenager in the club.
itbz8ar,PonderinLife,yahcxh,"I just felt really out of place. Like, as I was walking up to them clubs I was like “I am way out of my element.” I also felt kinda nervous. Lol. But it was cool seeing the guys in things out in public. Now if only I could get a boyfriend."
itfjaiz,PonderinLife,yahcxh,Oooooooooo a great idea!!! I’ll have to look into that!!
itc0nb5,,yahcxh,[deleted]
itbz3l2,PonderinLife,yahcxh,"Yeah going by myself felt like a challenge because everyone were in closed groups with their friends. I felt really out of place. But, I guess I got out my comfort zone? I saw a couple dudes look at me as they walked by, maybe they thought I was cute? IDK. I just didn’t feel adult enough to be in there. Lol."
itc28ir,throwawaylj89,yahcxh,You’re very critical of yourself and you really don’t need to be you’re only 24 just enjoy life and stop analysing everything. If I was in LA I’d say let’s get drunk go out and have a good time. That’s what being 24 is about. You’re a gay guy in LA! So many gay guys from other not so liberal countries would kill to be in your position so revel in it!
itfjci4,stillscottish1,yahcxh,"I hope it works out, they’re good for making friends, perhaps you’ll find people to go clubbing with once you get to know them"
itc12lv,PonderinLife,yahcxh,"See, I used to try to approach girls. So, I do have like 10% experience with it. 

But needless to say, I will be working my ass off in the gym over the winter. ‘Cause holy shit."
irp6r7g,exannihilist,xzziiy,"It depends on the build you choose. I have my own pc build for vfx and animation renders. I render for student films. You can save some by not going quadros. But they are the end game. Apart from that, i don’t see why you can’t use their config and build your own. Pudget system does it as well."
irp6xpd,PonderinLife,xzziiy,Ok I was just wondering if they’re a legit company or not. I’ve seen a few of their deep learning/AI builds and I’d love that for my own system. See Paul Lu the machine learning part now that Nuke has the copycat node.
irp8oxg,exannihilist,xzziiy,"It seems that they are more of a commercial business to deliver multiple units. If you’re independent, i’ll suggeat to clone their specs and build yourself. I’m not sure what resources Nuke machine learning uses but i know Nuke is CPU intensive. Used to have a Xeon. Shifted to 3900X. If you don’t use copycat node enough, 64/128GB RAM should be sufficient."
irpb1dh,PonderinLife,xzziiy,"Ok cool. 

And yeah the copycat node needs a good GPU to run. I’ve previously used it on a 3080, and it would put that thing through it’s paces. So a good GPU + CPU is a must."
iq12t1f,geowatt,xoxmnu,Yup. Red on the right = likes to get fisted
iq129e7,pileobunnies,xoxmnu,"Red is apparently code for fisting.  


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handkerchief\_code"
iq1f2o5,BillieShay,xoxmnu,Younger guy is signaling he’s an FF bottom
iq1dd3n,This-Ad6409,xoxmnu,maybe it was a gay cruising signal
iq1j0ig,WagsPup,xoxmnu,"Definitely hanky code in action, 2 guys, red and right back pocket showing, espc when coupled with the identical black dress is too specific a style to be co incidental. Hes flagging fisting bttm, u may have even seen a real life subbyboy or slaveboy there! Was he walking a few steps behind? Its called old guard leather protocol and theres not an insignificant number of guys in the fetish community into that and whilst it skews older there are younger guys into it too. 
I guess if its subtle enough and socially acceptable for the environment theres no reason these guys cant be found anywhere, many enjoy incorporating it into their daily lives this is what they r doing here.
Im certainly not into it myself but am into other kink / fetish such as pupplay  [Pupplay kink](https://www.reddit.com/r/PupPlay?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) so i know of it, have seen it and know guys into it.
Lookup:

Gay bdsm leather protocol

Folsom Street fair both San Fran and Berlin, DORE alley and youll see LOTS of pictures of this community doing their thing.

Below is an example of a young and pretty damn hot guy into it so whilst it skews older theres still a number of younger guys into it.

iq13x3x,JustSomeApparition,xoxmnu,"Y'all going to feel real silly if he just uses it to blow his nose and that just so happens to be the random color sitting on top that was grabbed to purchase, lol.

Yes I'm totally kidding, but could you imagine if that were really the case and you walked up to them and say ""how about we go back to my place and I give you a good fisting?!"" You would look insane, but it would be hilarious."
iq161t4,Real-Anywhere9215,xoxmnu,In the fucking 70s it would.
iq1k7zd,nzdennis,xoxmnu,Runny nose
iq2ghxf,HeyItsThatGuy84,xoxmnu,Gay code or gang related... bloods
iq192zb,froot_loop_dingus,xoxmnu,"Hanky code used to be a thing, I guess boomers still use it?"
iq17pws,PonderinLife,xoxmnu,Holy crap wow. I never thought I’d see something like that.
iq1flwe,PonderinLife,xoxmnu,Odd. ‘Cause this wasn’t a gay cruising area. This by the farmers market. This was the “bougie” part of town. Parents walking their 2 year olds around.
iq18uzw,PonderinLife,xoxmnu,*laughs in born in 1998*
iq2gp8m,PonderinLife,xoxmnu,Probably gay code. These two dudes looked nothing like gang members.
iq1e6dw,PonderinLife,xoxmnu,"I guess. ‘Cause the guy he was with was easily like 65. Had a head of full white hair. So, it’s possible he just got it from the older guy?"
iq1cxyz,trapped_iron_lung,xoxmnu,"Yeah, most likely you did not see anything like that. This code is dead."
iq1hmbz,BillieShay,xoxmnu,"Doesn’t necessarily mean the kid’s looking to get it right now. It’s just an old school way of putting it out there that this is what you’re in to. 
There are different colors for different “activities”"
iq1e2af,PonderinLife,xoxmnu,"I think I did see a code like that in public, that’s what sparked this post. Lol. I saw this dude walked down the street with this. And his partner looked to be easily like 65. So, maybe he got the gay code from the old timer."
ipscgzs,YosFan,xn909s,"Since it’s your first.. let him lead, take you what he wants. Then just get into it."
ipsinpa,MrTamorc,xn909s,"Just don't think about it being ""your chance"" or anything that would put undue pressure on yourself. At the end of the day it's just sticking it in and thrusting. Good luck and enjoy!"
ipsehu8,PonderinLife,xn909s,"Ok. Also, we’re probably meeting up tonight. I’m very nervous."
ipsr0a2,PonderinLife,xn909s,"Update: He ghosted after I asked for his address. However, I did get deep throated by a hot Spaniard. Let me cum on his face. He gagged in my cock like never before. And then he thanked me before he left. He was really sweet. I would’ve fucked him but he was just looking to blow. And he was short like me too. Why he gotta leave next week."
ipsh53d,YosFan,xn909s,"Try and not be, but that’s always easier said than done. Nervous can lead to performance, anxiety, and you don’t want that just relax, be yourself and let him guide you."
ipsqssk,PonderinLife,xn909s,"Update: He ghosted me. We agreed on meeting at 8 tonight. It is currently 8:30 and I am still virgin. 

However, I did just get deepthroated by a cute tattoo’d Spaniard. He said my dick was big, and let me cum on his face. I’ve never seen someone gag on my dick the way he did. And the accent. And he thanked me before he left. I might have a thing for Spaniards now."
ipstj8c,YosFan,xn909s,"Well, at least you got off.     Good start. Yeah I’d gag on 7+ also. 😳☺️. Write it off as a loss, and let it go in your head."
ipsu5dz,PonderinLife,xn909s,"Honestly, I don’t see this as a loss at all. Lol. I actually kinda like this other guy who was like 26 compared to the guy was probably 40 and just telling me he was 34."
ipsvbnv,YosFan,xn909s,Got it. Glad it worked out OK for you.
irtckuf,raeltireso96,y0qeqh,Lol. Really? Sounds like confirmation bias
irtdynn,gregm762,y0qeqh,"Well they're attractive so they get pursued more and get a lot of offers, so it makes sense they find it easier to couple up."
irt8lkq,MendejoElPendejo,y0qeqh,"I would also recommend therapy, it’ll help"
irud519,ravenclawpatronus46,y0qeqh,"I totally understand how you’re feeling. I’ve always been contemplating getting surgery. We all have insecurities, and it’s hard to not feel bitter towards our lot in life. I feel like everything would be easier and I would be happier and I would be in hot relationships and IG famous if I was more attractive. Pretty privilege is absolutely a thing. But you have to learn to not let other people dictate the relationship you have with yourself. That’s the most important/longest relationship you’ll ever have. It’s hard, but learning to love yourself is always the first step. Definitely recommend seeing a therapist, and working on self esteem. Don’t let the smart asses get to you on here. It’s something we all struggle with."
irt890d,_V_A_Y_,y0qeqh,"Well it makes sense, if they’re looking for a relationship attractive people will find one easier."
irtg6sg,WildCard211,y0qeqh,What a shock heh
irtgj7i,WildCard211,y0qeqh,"If it's hard to you who have a place, imagine for me who hasn't, same age and dating os basically a nightmare"
irujumb,thrwAwaydogo232,y0qeqh,Go out and hit on a guy.  You can't bitch about being single and a virgin without trying to hit on someone
irvap6j,TotallyInVogue,y0qeqh,Sounds more like you’ve got an ugly personality rather than an ugly face
irtrr48,Zedek_Swai,y0qeqh,What do you have to offer other than just looks?
irttyi4,lahs2017,y0qeqh,"I find the opposite the attractive guys are single bc they have a lot of options and don't want to be tied down

If they are in relationships they're usually open"
iruj9r3,Jamfour9,y0qeqh,"As someone who is about to turn 32 in a few months: don’t waste the time. Truth is, you might go another decade or more without a bf or significant other. You don’t want to look back and feel regret because you spent the time miserable. Wishing and hoping didn’t change things for me. I’m literally feeling the exact same frustration. It comes and goes in waves. I can either accept that I didn’t get what I wanted. Or I can pout and complain and waste more time. Bitching and being upset won’t gift you a significant other. Truth is if you were to attract someone they could be more insecure and fucked up than you. 

I think gay men could benefit from support systems and finding friends. Cause this relationship fantasizing is an epidemic. Even those dating these days are poly, multi, busting it open for everyone. The fantasy is just that. You’re probably going to stay single. I’m about, let’s see, 20 years into singledom. My new focus will be filling my time with shit that brings me peace, not necessarily joy. Then I’ll try to find gay community, so I can gain empathizers. Then I’ll keep trying to find folks to have sex with. Cause who can go without frequent dick? For the rest, let’s all just say fuck it. Even the breeders are not getting married and having kids anymore."
iruqpxs,Shootingcomet,y0qeqh,"Aww, spend more time with those that unconditionally love you and have supported you. Keep searching for gay connections but remember those who did not care about your looks or lack thereof."
irv7irs,Different_Ad_7456,y0qeqh,"Tbh as an attractive person myself I easily and recently got a boyfriend at 18 and I do agree that people prefer looks over body. But there is always going to be someone who will love you for who you are, so please don’t give up on love."
irvbrxl,doukaremydee,y0qeqh,"Most handsome guys are kind of players, they dated someone for a while then break up. You can be their friends and wait for your turn. But don't say I don't warn you, rose has thorns."
irvgahh,RevolutionaryMud1174,y0qeqh,Have you ever *asked* someone to date you?
irwjwjy,Puzzleheaded_Time719,y0qeqh,What kind of men do you pursue?
irtx4po,thewellnessforyear,y0qeqh,The water is wet
irthiyh,PonderinLife,y0qeqh,But it’s true. All the hot guys I’ve seen are taken. Maybe surgery will change my life.
irthblo,PonderinLife,y0qeqh,It kinda sucks that the only reason why I’m single is because I’m ugly AF. I really want surgery now. ‘Cause no one pursues me.
iqk67gd,Character-Attitude85,xsexh8,"No one ghosts someone after giving him his address 4 times. He either didn’t know the closing time or he knew it closed at 8 and would meet you there and claim he didn’t know, “let’s just go to my place”."
iqk7o17,TaroBubbleT,xsexh8,Who agrees to coffee at 8pm?

iqk7gew,PonderinLife,xsexh8,"Thing is, dudes not far from me. Lol. And I was willing to meet at his place. I just wanted to meet in person first ‘cause I don’t wanna risk getting murdered. Lol. Like, the pics he sent over were hot. But, whose to say that was actually him. For all I know dude was trying to get me to his house and he might’ve been 30 years older and 100 pounds over the picture he sent over."

His place. Said he would love to ride it, I said ok. I told him I was going to jump in the shower beforehand and that I needed an address to enter into the GPS. After I asked for that address, radio silence from him. I blocked him the next day."
iqf0s3i,gayozurone,xripwx,"He's right thought. What kind of dumb assumption is that. It may likely be true, but not courteous to point it out . Besides, you replied back with some racist ass shit too like tf are you whining abt?"

iqf4xfv,,xripwx,That’s an odd opening question. Even if you asked “so you found the big-cock guy you’re looking for?” It sounds weird too.
iqezzpu,Uppernwbear,xripwx,"Unless there was something in his profile to indicate he was looking for white boys, you led with a pretty odd question that could be considered racist.  What prompted you to ask the question?

Racist or not, he makes a good point about assumptions.

I am a person of color, by the way."
iqfdmby,HotChunkySoup,xripwx,"When it comes to folks with ""racial preferences"", everyone hates everyone who is a different race than them, with 2 exceptions: 

1. Everyone loves non-Black Latinos
2. Everyone hates Black people, including other Black people."
iqf5p3w,DiscoLemonade82,xripwx,"Strange conversation. 

What I don’t understand is why at the beginning you asked, “So you found the white boy you’re looking for?” 

Because it seems like you attacked him with the assumption that he’s looking for white men, when he messaged YOU, a black man. Did he not know you’re black? It just seems very random how you brought white guys into it...is there some missing context here?"
iqf92qx,Parking_Cat4735,xripwx,Yeah no you're the problem. Why the hell would you ask him if he got a white guy? So much wrong with that
iqff5eb,dyingeventually,xripwx,"i get where you coming from, but it’s best to give people the benefit of the doubt. 

Personally, if a black guy (well anyone for that matter) has preferences in their bio which i’m not a part of, i generally don’t reply. 

There was a really cute black guy i wanted to message, but saw in his bio he had “whites/latinos to the front”. 

I guess later on his saw i viewed his profile and messaged me, which i ignored him. 

I think outwardly sharing preferences is just a net negative more than positive, so i try not to associate with ppl who do it,

I think it shows a lot of pain/bitterness that your 1st instinct is to make assumptions about why someone is approaching you. I’d work on that because i believe your in the wrong."
iqfjbs0,Ash_an_bun,xripwx,">So you found the white boy you’re looking for?

Keepin it classy OP."
iqfk8dy,raeltireso96,xripwx,"I think you made an assumption and he just said ""you know what? Ima choose violence."""
iqglvwd,,xripwx,You instigated the entire thing…
iqf9s7x,Soonerpalmetto88,xripwx,Anyone can be racist.
iqf9wc7,PonderinLife,xripwx,"Now, what’s so bad about pointing it out?"
iqf0so9,PonderinLife,xripwx,"Ok but I don’t see how what I said was racist though. I mean, I live in America. So, I do know that a lot of men just hit up POC’s when they run out of white twinks. So I assumed that with this guy."
iqfps9m,PonderinLife,xripwx,"I don’t hate the guy, or his skin tone, I just thought it was weird that he responded with the black nut question."
iqfqzyr,PonderinLife,xripwx,"Because I’ve had people who only go after the white boys message me once they can’t get the white boys they wanted. Like I’m some type of consolation prize for them. That’s where this comes from, knowing that some dude sees me as 2nd best. And I’ve seen white men do this, I’ve seen black men do this, I’ve seen a lot of men do this."
iqf9u2c,PonderinLife,xripwx,What exactly is wrong with that?
iqfq7uq,PonderinLife,xripwx,"See I don’t have a preference on race. I’ve gone after black guys, latin guys, Asian guys, etc. I just get a feeling that by the time lost guys message me, they’ve run out of the white twinks that saturate LA. Lol. Like, why else do dudes message me?"
iqfpvc9,PonderinLife,xripwx,"Not classy, honest. It’s the first thought on my mind."
iqfpu4l,PonderinLife,xripwx,Very much this.
ipyfjxh,CalifornianDownUnder,xo5zmc,Had you discussed using condoms before your last message?
ipyk2gm,raeltireso96,xo5zmc,"Ghosting is normalized now. Everyone does it, in pretty much every venue. It sucks but that's what it is."
ipx6k8w,FloridAsh,xo5zmc,"It happens, but kind of unusual with guys 30+"
ipyqh1j,PonderinLife,xo5zmc,Yes. I even have the condom’s tag in my bio. So it’s stayed up front.
ipyqkmx,PonderinLife,xo5zmc,"Yeah but to agree to meet up just to ghost that person, seems extra shitty though?"
ipytrc4,raeltireso96,xo5zmc,It's very shitty
iqzi1ev,_V_A_Y_,xv552h,"1. Stop harassing him.

2. Comparison is the thief of joy. There will always be someone hotter than you. The only person it’s fair to compare yourself to is your past self."
iqzek2l,NinjaShredder,xv552h,"Well, from what you write at least it seems that you more or less only focus on looks - his and yours. What you know about him seems limited to what he chooses to post on social media which is a very incomplete picture of a person and can hide some considersble flaws. 

 While I appreciate a good looking guy as much as anyone, I also know that lots of people look beautiful, but are narcissistic douchebags. And I am especially wary of those who post photos of themselves all of the time. They tend to be into themselves to an unhealthy degree and obviously like the attention. 

And other than you not truly knowing anything about his personality, you might just not be his type. No shame in that. Happens to everyone. Plenty of fish (or gay men) in the sea!"
ir0jery,PonderinLife,xv552h,Ok I’m not harassing him. And it’s kinda killing me knowing I’m ugly AF in comparison. I also look younger than he does even though I’m older. So I also feel more like a kid while he looks like an actual adult. I hate looking young ISTG.
iqzf6tw,PonderinLife,xv552h,"Oh I already know I’m not his type. Lol. I realized that the second I looked a this pictures. I’m so far from that guys type. And I’m ok with that. He doesn’t owe me anything. I think my thing is, I wanna be him ‘cause he’s so hot and confident. Meanwhile I’m neither of those. And he seems to be living the good life. 

I do feel that if I had a nose job, and a airline transplant, I’d be beautiful. I got out of braces in June. I kinda wish I could be into myself more or post more about myself. I think it’s the confidence. Or the fact that I don’t have anyone anyone pursuing me. I don’t have any guys in my DM’s. No one simping over me in my comments."

is4fkhm,evki2003,y2plb7,"There is a cult near the town where I live. I've heard countless stories about how bad the conditions of the cult were. 

Firstly, anyone not in the cult and who is unescorted by someone in the cult might (and sometimes have) been shot. They are extremely secretive about the practices of their society. The police cant do anything either, because they are ""standing their ground"" on their property. 

Secondly, they believe that ""alternative"" or ""traditional"" medicine is the way to go for medical treatment. There was a woman who tried to give birth. She was in labor for more than two days. They finally gave up and got the woman to the local hospital. She ended up giving birth to conjoined twins. The children were pronounced dead at birth (because the kids were conjoined at the head). Thankfully, they admitted the woman in time to save her. Unfortunately for the woman though, she was ejected from the cult after she was discharged from the hospital. The cult was convinced she gave birth to a demon.

If you want to join a cult, commune, etc. we can't stop you. But do be careful."

iquivk4,_V_A_Y_,xu9avd,"As someone who strongly considered it but ended up deciding not to there are many reasons:

1. The effects are temporary, unless you’re fine with dying pretty early you need to cycle on and off and you will lose much of what you gained when off.

2. They’re not some magic get big quick substance, you won’t look like those pictures you linked after one cycle. Most people who do steroids actually don’t look like what you imagine steroid users to look like (like those pictures you linked). Those people are experienced lifters, know what they’re doing, and have been using steroids for an extended amount of time.

3. Just based on how you describe your diet, you don’t know what you’re doing when it comes to muscle building, and it’s probable your workouts could use improvement as well. You can improve in other ways. The only people for whom the risk/reward ratio of steroids is worth it are those who are competing and need to push past genetic limits.

4. Even doing them as “safely” as possible comes with risks like infertility, permanent hair loss, gyno, and needing to be on TRT for life, not to mention the harder to see ones like liver damage, and circulatory system damage that will cause issues later in life."
iqupvsb,Alarming_Leather3458,xu9avd,"Dude, I'm going to try and share my opinions with you. Some are based on facts and others on observations. In the end you're still going to do what you want to do. I'm hoping that you won't do it or at least wait a few years, but at least you'll know a bit more than before. So..

First of all you are way too young for roids. Your body and test levels are still at an optimal level for muscle growth. Adding in roids now will just help you achieve what you could have done naturally along with some side effects like potential hair loss. Imo the guy from Instagram's body is totally achievable without roids. 

Second, you don't give us enough information to help out with the rest. Have you been working out from the start of the pandemic or when exactly, how many times a week, how do you train? This will all make a difference to the advice we can give. 

Third, it doesn't sound like you have a good understanding with regards to diet. You need to have an understanding of how much protein you need to consume a day. Imo, with the information you've given, you should be bulking at this point with the aim to cut later on. This means that you need to consume a lot more protein (at least 110-130g) imo. Then you need to track carbs and fats as well which you can do with a calorie tracker. You can eat a variety of food not just chicken and rice. 

Fourth, there are tons of YouTube content out there with guys that really care about men trying to build their bodies. Just search 'bodybuilding food' and see what comes up. 

Again, you can achieve your goals without the use of roids. I hope you choose not to.

EDIT: After another comment I went to your profile and saw some stunning pics there. Tbh your knowledge about diet made me think you are a noob, but if that's really you then you don't need roids or most of my advice! Plus you look way better than the guy on Instagram. 

PS I'm leaving this up because I don't want to delete the comment and would also like to show you how you present yourself and the advice you then get vastly differs from reality."
iquinqk,RetroRiboflavin,xu9avd,I looked at the pictures you posted and you look better than the goal pictures tbh.
iquinxy,frostcranberry,xu9avd,As long as you understand the side effects.
iqujkb6,SameSteak738,xu9avd,"The muscles in the goal pictures are matured muscles. You still a few years too young. Your progress is incredible and if you are currently natural, jumping to steroids will stunt your natural potential. Remember that bodybuilding is a marathon, not a race. You are never going to be done improving. Hastening a little progress will only get you the next challenge faster. However, if you are hellbent on going through it, there are better options than steroids. 

You have done a great job and looking amazing for your age and time invested. I truly hope juiced up dudes don’t influence you into throwing away such an awesome accomplishment."
iqukajr,overkoalafied24,xu9avd,Why don’t you spend money on a trainer instead of steroids
iqulg9k,rigimonoki-over,xu9avd,"Don’t, muscles and a well shape is earned through hard work and dedication, being able to get a good body after months work is well earned"
iquma5t,gayozurone,xu9avd,Same bro. Working out its so slow and takes so much out of me. And the progress is so slow. Having an basic face and being top feels like im not taken seriously if i dont have those big bulging muscle to compensate for.
iqun02x,toomeneff,xu9avd,"Just hire a physical trainer for like 2-3 months then do things on your own, that’s how I did it 💪"
iquplaa,Putrid-Ad-9140,xu9avd,Maybe can we see how your body looks like now . That's when we can judge if there is progress or not
iquynw2,renerdrat,xu9avd,"There's lots of alternative medicines and/or ""researchers chemicals"" that don't mess with your natural body's test like roids do that you should try first. Also are you eating enough and do you take supplements to support growth Your body utilizes a lot of nutrients to optimize muscle growth. 
Also I think the bodybuilding forum would be a better source of information lol"
iqv0vli,Ready-Pangolin-1352,xu9avd,"More calories, more sleep, and make sure you are actually training hard. Do big lifts like bench press and squats instead of bicep curls and light weight pulldowns. 
If you want to gain muscle you need to eat enough and not be afraid of losing your precious 6 pack. 
I’ve been lifting for 18 years and have made a million mistakes along the way but learned a lot too so feel free to ask. 
Also about an ig body, those guys do NOT look like that all the time. Only in perfect lighting, taken with a pump, flexing hard, and all bodybuilders and models seriously dehydrate themselves to increase definition before a shoot. Most bodybuilders are on the verge of collapse when they are on stage. Don’t hold yourself to such high standards or you are bound for disappointment"
iqvn6oi,Fiberotter,xu9avd,"Why don't you get a professional training plan and a meal plan, stick to it, save money, improve your body and health and not ruin it long term? If anyone could do it there wouldn't be actual professionals. 

You surely know Jeff Cavaliere from Youtube? Get a program for a hundred bucks, he gives you a diet plan too. Maybe another hundred for a dedicated core program (abs, lower back). Do what he says and you won't stress. And you'd also enjoy nice varied food (and lots of protein shakes).

The other posters have said enough about the idiocy of Instagram and steroids, so I won't go there. I've been working out for about 15 years and I can tell you the chaps like you who went the steroids shortcut in their early 20ies back then now have neither the stamina, the strength nor the health I do. My abs are year-round and my arms don't deflate if I take a break for a couple of weeks."
iqvtltf,Physical_Maize_3646,xu9avd,Not worth it. Just two test cycles fucked up my lipids and liver enzymes
iquom44,Great_Name_Dude,xu9avd,"You might need to eat more. It’s been a while, but when I was working on muscles like that, I was eating large meals every couple hours and protein shakes after workouts. Legs so sore I could never walk straight, and arms so tired I got stuck in my shirt one night and needed my workout buddy to get it off. Good times. Anyway, steroids are bad mmkay?"
iquje9s,PonderinLife,xu9avd,"I understand I’m still gonna need to step in the gym and put in the work. I understand that 100%. I’m just wondering if I should get on them to help me get to my goal faster. 

I might be ok with the infertility thing ‘cause I don’t really want kids. And I don’t think my future/potential partner would either. 

But how could my diet be improved? I know that you can’t put train a bad diet. But I thought that chicken and rice was a good diet for that."
iquqrfl,PonderinLife,xu9avd,"Ok wow. Thank you for this advice ‘cause this was a lot to type out. After reading this, I definitely feel that I could re-orient my diet. And my tracking as well. I think that is one thing that I could do better in. 

Also, why is everyone saying I’m so young. I’m not. I feel old AF. Especially compared to all the other guys in LA. And I also feel like I have to catch-up to other people I see who are younger with far better body’s. So yeah it might be achievable without roids/PED’s. I know that PED’s will help me get to my goal a lot quicker (in combination with putting in the work). Maybe taking months what would have taken years. 

And I started working out in January 2020 and just kept with it (my state didn’t close down the gyms). So I just went to workout after classes. So I try to go to the gym 3-5 times a week. With upper body on Mon/Wed/Friday with legs on Tues/Thur. Usually for around an hour."
iquj2bu,PonderinLife,xu9avd,I do not feel like that. I feel like my body is trash compared to those guys.
iquiu4q,PonderinLife,xu9avd,"I’ve read up on the side effects (gyno, horrible acne, shrunken testicles, rage). I was just wondering what other guys in this sub who have taken it would say."
iqukcoq,PonderinLife,xu9avd,"Honestly, I look mediocre compared to those guys. Plus it’s so odd to see teenagers with better body’s than mine. IDK, compared to the guys I’ve seen on social media, I just feel like I should have a far better body by now. ‘Cause everyone looms a lot better than me. 

So, what would say it a better alternative to roids? SARMS?"
israw27,blue-dog-bike,y6uq1l,Or maybe you cut him some slack for being fake (in a nice way) after you were fake (in a cunty way) with him?
israxv3,rajhcraigslist,y6uq1l,I don't generally try to contact guys who ghosted me. I sometimes think of them but won't bother if they aren't very good about keeping in touch.
iss3g3p,redwoodgood,y6uq1l,"You blocked his number and he respected that boundary, it doesn't mean he wasn't thinking about you."
ist7c8u,jmat83,y6uq1l,"Dude, don’t be cruel. This guy is interested in being friends with you and you’re jerking him around. Either be friends and stay in touch or don’t, but stop with this block/unblock/block/unblock do-I-ghost-him-do-I-not bullshit. Get your head on straight."
ist8hs6,misht92,y6uq1l,"I think you are overthinking here, it doesn't have to be serious. Maybe he just had a fleeting thought of you that week, and then you texted him. If someone blocked me I would not make an effort to try and reach out through other socials."
isugnwf,RevolutionaryMud1174,y6uq1l,"Why didn’t he message me then if he was just thinking about me? 

Uhhhh maybe cause you f-ing blocked him out of the blue and ghosted him for a month. Probably respecting your boundaries. 

Also, wtf, why don’t you just tell him you’re not comfortable being friends if you’re not. “Hey I don’t want to be friends because of x, because we’ve hooked up and personally I’m not interested in seeking friendship after someone ‘kissed my right asscheek’”"
isrbpp3,PonderinLife,y6uq1l,Help. He just text me again like 2 minutes ago. What do?!?
isrbt4i,PonderinLife,y6uq1l,"Now see that’s the thing. When we were talking, we’d talk about every other day. I’d go may 3-4 days. So he knows that when I am interested I can be a very good communicator. But he just text me like 2 minutes ago and IDK what to do."
issnmr1,PonderinLife,y6uq1l,But *why* would he be thinking about me though? I don’t get it.
istc60f,PonderinLife,y6uq1l,"I think I approach situations like this with a “what do you want” kind of mindset. Like, “Ok what does this guy want and why is he talking to me.” Which is why stuff like this throws me for a loop. ‘Cause………..he hasn’t been thinking about me at all, so why try and make it seem like he’s all nice about stuff. Especially when the first time we met he talked about how a guy he liked ended up ghosting him."
istcf7d,PonderinLife,y6uq1l,Ok that makes sense. I still haven’t responded to his message.
isujld8,PonderinLife,y6uq1l,"I figured ghosting him would be far easier than just having an honest conversation with him. 

Also, it’s not ‘cause he kissed my right asscheek. It’s because being in the friend zone is something I’m really not keen on doing. Staying in someone’s orbit after they’ve expressed disinterest is one thing I’m choosing not to do this year. To me it seems a little simpish. Plus he’ll be talking about all the new guys he’s meeting/fucking, and I’m supposed to sit there and act like I give a damn when I don’t. I
To me, the whole entire dynamic would seem really fake. 

He also said “I’ve been thinking about what we are.”. We weren’t anything. We met up twice, he left town for a month. We weren’t anything. That’s another thing I thought was weird."
isrc7f6,blue-dog-bike,y6uq1l,Go hit it
isugrpu,RevolutionaryMud1174,y6uq1l,"Because he likes you as a friend, but not more, that’s why."
isu4cet,jmat83,y6uq1l,And your logical next step was to jerk off with him and then ghost him. Okay.
isul4oz,RevolutionaryMud1174,y6uq1l,"He’s saying “I’ve been thinking about what we are” because he’s transitioning into proposing moving the connection between the two of you into “just friends”. That’s why he said that. 

Also, you should just say that. Don’t say “sure” then block him. Say sorry that’s not for me, I don’t like mixing friendships with past hookups… and that’s it. 

If he was able to accept not messaging you for a month, he’s definitely able to accept not being friends"
isrcnoh,PonderinLife,y6uq1l,"Never mind, that was another dude I don’t like/ghosted from yesterday."
isu4pf5,PonderinLife,y6uq1l,Actually no. I wanted to date this guy. *He* was the one who told me that he wasn’t interested in dating or being sexual. Which is ok. He doesn’t owe me that. But I also don’t owe him friendship either. Lol. You get nothing out of being in the “friendzone”.
isum6gu,PonderinLife,y6uq1l,"Honestly, I think I’m just gonna block and ghost him again. It just seems easier than being honest. Plus it’s been 3 months so it’s not like anyone really cares. Lol."
isu4u0w,jmat83,y6uq1l,"Then STOP TALKING TO HIM. If you already made up your mind, then wtf is the point of this post? Attention?"

itcmvi1,previous-solutions,yaseov,"According to the Bible, Hell is eternal. 

Below are 2 verses from Matthew 

Matt 25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels  
  
Matt 25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.

Here is another from Revelation

Revelation 20:10  
10 And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
itd8jsn,SnooRegrets4878,yaseov,"Hell is for real, and it is eternal. It was created for Satan and his followers. But those who reject God in this life, will be rejected by God in the afterlife."
itd4cav,Wild_Hook,yaseov,"There are actually 2 ways in which the word ""hell"" is used in scriptures.

1. It is a temporary existence in the spirit world that will last until the end of the Millineum when death and hell are conquered. It is also called the spirit prison by Peter in First Peter 3:19. The wicked and those who never heard the gospel will be taught there and most will accept the merciful atonement of Christ.  ""For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.""  First Peter 4:6
2. It is the place where the sons of perdition go. These are those who have been taught the gospel and understand it but have an eternal hatred for God. These are Satan and his followers and those who have committed the unpardonable sin having known God through the power of the Holy Ghost and then rejected Him, of whom Christ said that all other sins would be forgiven (Matthew 12:31,32). This place is also called outer darkness because those who dwell there are eternally cast out of God's presence by their own choice. It is spiritual darkness, not an eternally burning tortuous hell. Here on earth, all people are enlightened to various degrees by our conscience or the light of truth, or the spirit of Christ, or""the true light that lighteth every man who comes into the world"" (John 1:9) I suspect that those in spiritual darkness will likely have no such light because they rejected it. These people will apparently be in torment. Wickedness does not produce happiness."
itcvtr0,Inevitable_Ad183,yaseov,Yup. Forever. And ever. Never will end.
ite9hgw,DillonEspe,yaseov,"The lake of fire and Hell are different locations. Hell is a temporary holding location for the unsaved. After the great white throne judgment, the unsaved and satan and the antichrist and false prophet and all the demons go to the lake of fire for all eternity."
itcmsjw,,yaseov,Yes. It's eternal torment and punishment.
itd679y,Malcolm3535Fighter,yaseov,Yes it’s for eternity means forever and forever no purgatory here your spirit lives on not your flesh.
itdn7dk,blue-pixie-,yaseov,"2 Thessalonians 1:9
They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might

Yes God is not a man that He should lie.

Numbers 23:19
God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

Mark 9:43
If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell, where the fire never goes out


God does not lie, hell is punishment. The devil does lie, satan has been showing his followers a lie about what hell is like in their secret cult aka illuminati. They truly believe Satan’s lies of this false realm where hell is made to look like something it’s not. When they “transport” to other dimensions and stuff it’s all a deception of Satan, but these people think they are clued into something others don’t know. They do horrible things in secret and believe satan will make them powerful in hell or something. An ego that causes them eternal damnation unless they repent quickly. Some people just have too big of an ego to believe, but we all need repentance. We all have sinned which is why the blood of Jesus is needed for everyone to have everlasting life.

Revelations 20:10
And the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever."
itczsjb,MashmallowRabbit,yaseov,"I think the question is tricky. As has been said before, everybody agrees that there is an eternal fire prepared for the devil and it’s angels Matt25:41

The questions is whether the souls will be suffering forever on the fire. Truth is, nobody knows but the more I think about it, I think the answer is no.

Matthew 10:28–Rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.

James 4:12–There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.

Philippians 3:19–Whose end is destruction.

2 Thessalonians 1:9–Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction

The idea that souls are kept burning in hell implies that souls cannot be destroyed but Matt 10:28 clearly shows that they can.

It seems that after people die they are no more until one day God will raise them to the judgement of Christ. 2 Corinthians 5:10. Then, for some, comes the second death.

I don’t remember the bible verse but it made parallels with hell and sodom and Gomorrah. Fire and brimstone came and the place was reduced to ashes.. that is why it is a second death. Otherwise, it would not be called a second death.

Seems to me that the second death is achieved by means of an eternal fire"
itczrph,Hanakos_ToiletWater,yaseov,yes. i don’t know why this is a debated topic in the first place.
itcmcno,JustToLurkArt,yaseov,That’s hotly debated. The only consensus is it’s torment and totally avoidable.
itd7lcz,Talancir,yaseov,Yes.
itcl0je,HonestGodQuestions,yaseov,"Yes.

I don't believe anyone suffers there forever though."
itduz0h,shawnintexas,yaseov,Ok ive seen some comments where people are saying hell is for eternity.  The scripture never says this. The scripture says hell is forever so yes it has a beginning and it will have an end. That is what forever is. Heaven is eternal and only Heaven. How long is forever is anyones guess but to be seperated totally from God for even a second would feel like an eternity.
itdou4d,Serpentine878,yaseov,Yes
itcqo8l,ManoDeOro_,yaseov,Yep
ite2id7,thiswilldefend,yaseov,if it wasnt forever why would he let his son die for that...
itdf68p,itbwtw,yaseov,"There are quite a few orthodox opinions on Hell in Christianity. Most of us are only familiar with the one point of view we were raised with.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell_in_Christianity

The idea that God will not leave anyone unsaved has been a valid perspective throughout Christian history. This ultimately is the view that God cannot lose and that God's love can and will successfully 'woo' and convert everyone before 'it is finished'.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_universalism"
itcu52j,TChoppa_Style,yastpf,"Yes, so is Heaven."
itd63xh,rbibleuser,yastpf,"Short answer: yes

Longer answer: Hell (the ""lake of fire"" which Jesus and others warned of) is an eternal place of punishment, see the references given elsewhere in this thread. At the end of all things, Death and Hades (the realm of the dead) will be cast into the lake of fire (which we generally call ""hell"" in English), along with Satan and his angels, the Beast and the false prophet, and anyone whose name is not written in the book of life.

You will sometimes hear things along the lines: ""Every child is born a sinner and all sin is so evil and offensive to God that he must cast it into hell and burn it forever. Therefore, even a child who dies without salvation is thrown into hell."" This line of discussion is a complete and total failure to take the text seriously -- it is nothing but baseless speculation passed off as having something to do with the Bible when, in fact, it has nothing to do with it.

Here are some relevant considerations:

- God is more just than we are, not less. If we can plainly see that something is unjust, so can God. This inborn moral sense (part of the image of God within us) is *why* we are liable for our actions before God. So if God himself were to undermine that by saying something like, ""burning this baby forever in the flames of hell might *seem* unjust to your puny mortal minds but, in fact, according to my transcendent holiness, it is actually just"", he would be undermining the very basis of our own liability to divine judgment for our actions!

- Sin is deadly and, ultimately, leads to hell. Even though no one can just ""slip"" into hell, the warnings of Scripture are clear: each sin, no matter how small, is a first step down a path that, ultimately, leads to eternal death. The reason that the terrifying imagery of a lava-lake is used in Scripture is that we ought to be as motivated to escape sin and hell as we would be to avoid the edge of a cliff over which there is a literal lava-lake. The danger is so great that we are instinctively motivated to run as far away as possible. Someone who dances on the edge of a cliff where there is a lava-lake below is reckless and has gone mad. Scripture warns that, when we indulge in sin, we are like that person dancing on the edge of the cliff -- reckless and mad.

- The lake of fire or the Abyss is not God's torture-dungeon where he burns naughty boys and girls for all of eternity for being smart-mouths or snatching each others' bread rolls. Rather, it's a cosmic structure that is an eternal opposite of the being of God. We can find ""the deep"" (Hebrew: `tehom`) mentioned in Genesis 1:2, where the Spirit is hovering over it; compare to Rev. 14:9-11. Clearly, this is not something that God created, because it is already there in verse 2, before the six-day creation. This is why the New Testament describes damnation as a kind of ""letting go"" or ""giving up"" or ""casting out"" -- God is not dragging people off into his torture dungeon, rather, he is casting the damned out of his own Creation (order, peace, love) into the untamed wilderness of the Abyss. It is as Jesus described it: a place of weeping and gnashing of teeth, where the fire is never quenched and the worm never dies.

- God is inherently reluctant to destroy the wicked. He is more reluctant to destroy the wicked than any just human is to punish the guilty (Ez. 33:11). The Bible speaks extensively about God's patience and long-suffering in enduring the crimes of the wicked upon the righteous. This is one of the reasons believers are called to suffer on behalf of Jesus -- our acceptance of the crimes of the wicked is part of how God is able to forgive them... and we were once in the very same position, 1 Cor. 6:11.

- There is such a thing as an infinite sin and the only proper punishment for it is eternal death, Rom. 3:8b. Once again, no one ever ""slipped"" into committing such sin, but the blasphemy of the Jews who hated Jesus (John 8:12-59) and the betrayal of Judas show us a picture of ""the end of the road"", the final point of reprobation beyond which there is nothing but wrath, Heb. 10:26,27. All sin, even minor sin, is a first step on the path whose final destination was reached by Judas and the Jews who crucified Jesus. It is a fate so terrifying that we can hardly bear to contemplate it and, therefore, we ought to abhor sin, we ought to abhor taking even that first step along a path whose final destination is so horrific."
itdjg4x,Believeth_In_Him,yastpf,"
The Lake of Fire is a real place and is where those who do not pass the Judgment go. All that are sent to the Lake of Fire will be destroyed. This is for all eternity.
Only those who are not written in The Book of Life will be sent to the Lake of Fire. Those who are written in the Book of Life will receive the Crown of Life, which is everlasting life.

Matthew 10:28 “And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.”

Revelation 20:15 “And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.”"
itdl94p,Follow_Christ,yastpf,"According to Jesus, yes. 'Everlasting' and 'eternal' are the same Greek word in the verse below.

itgogw9,MuitoLegal,yastpf,"When it says eternal in the Bible, it is the Greek word “aion”.  This is where we get our word “eon”

Does “eon” mean forever? No. We say for “eons” as multiple long periods or ages.

“Hell” is a word mentioned 13 times in the Bible, and really can just translate as death.

God himself in Genesis didn’t condemn us to hell torture, he condemned us to death itself.

And finally I believe all will be raised again like Jesus to this earth, as “For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.” 1 Cor 15:22"

itdt4cp,mrcleeves,yastpf,"Yes but also no. The Punishment is forever, meaning the people who go to hell will never go to heaven. However it does not mean they will be burning forever. It says in the Bible only the saved will have eternal life, if one is to be burned forever it means they will have to be alive forever so they can be burned. This makes no sense. Therefore the more likely interpretation is that the fire is temporary, and you burn until it’s your time to die (this applies for everyone, including satan). And once all who went to hell are dead, our new earth will start to be rebuilt. It’s makes no sense for Gods character or with other context in the Bible for people to burn forever. That’s not loving nor just. However, the smoke of hell (the consequences) are forever, as those people will be dead forever. This makes most logical sense."
itdidwk,yourveryownuncle,yastpf,Yes
itcwne0,SeekSweepGreet,yastpf,"Mike, the Bible has this promise:

> *“For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.”* - ***John 3:16 (KJV)***

It promises everlasting life to those who believe, at the denial that they perish(die). If you're in hell forever as is believed popularly, you're alive. That's not what is promised.

Matthew 3:12 His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor, gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

it2ckpl,CrossCutMaker,y8kci4,"Since you're asking for us to pray to Jesus for you I'm assuming you believe he is God and if so, you cannot be possessed by demons because you have the Spirit of God indwelling you. Ask for how to cast out demons from others...there's only one way and that is to share the gospel with them and when they believe the Spirit of God enters them and removes the demons. For more on that..

it0pmzp,Nightwing1225,y8kci4,"Of course my friend. I recommend a few things actually
1. Get a prayer book with powerful prayers; one’s like the our father prayer, Lord have mercy, glory to God etc.

2.visit a priest and other like minded Christians to remain strong in the faith and find help

3.ask you guardian angel for help, God has assigned all of us one and it’s important to stay close and ask them for help

4.despite common misconception, it is not idolatry to ask the saints for help (there is no worship). They have dealt with what we have and worse. They were so strong in their faith that many were martyred. They battled the temptations of demons and there are so many wonderful, inspiring and tragic stories of so many of these saints. Even if you don’t ask for their prayer and intersession then atleast look into their inspiring stories. There are so many you’re bound to even find one that relates to you

5.I need to work on this very much; get more involved with the scriptures by reading and/or listen to audio of it and watch videos of people talking about it.

Hope this all helped my friend"

is91l67,RebelPoetically,y3hgp6,"Jesus could not come until Israel became a nation again. God made it clear that when Israel became a nation in a day, it would be the sign the end times has started. 

Israel became a nation in a day again in 1948 if I recall the correct date. It was after the Holocaust and involved the United Nations. 

Israel is God’s prophetic time clock. God said when Israel builds the temple it is a sign again. Today they have the resources to build the temple in 3 months. They plan by 2023 to build a train station from the airport to the temple.

Weeks ago they found 5 animal sacrifices that need by God’s decree, to meet impossible rare standards….They found 5 and bought them from Texas when one alone is nearly impossible to meet the standard.

God also said when Israel divides it’s land or someone else does, this is a great sign and judgement will come on those dividing Israel’s land. God said it would come when Israel has no government.

Today Israel has no government and Israel acting leader (temporary one) said he supports Two State Solution.

The point is simple, we’re clearly in the end times. We don’t even need Israel to see this.

God said when Euphrates dries up, it’s part of end times. Go look on YouTube and Google how low the Euphrates has dried up in a manner of just 3 months. 

Scientist say by 2030 if not by less the Euphrates will be gone. God makes it objectively clear the Euphrates is part of the return of Jesus.

So unless you expect the river to magically fill up by the power of God today and exist by 2030, I don’t see how we have any reason to reject this clear sign.

So the point is again simple, thing’s God said would occur in detail, have occurred and still keep occurring. The bible is 25% of God saying thing’s will come in the future, Scholars say this is so as well. 

According to even secular scholars by the bible’s own words, nearly 70% of what God spoke is fulfilled if not more. 

Those people 2,000 years ago didn’t have a valid reason to believe God would come in their lifetime, we do."
is92fhm,SneakPlatypus,y3hgp6,They did bro. You can’t read bro. I can read though. And it’s 2000 years late and every century people are sure it’s this one. But nah you’re right this time. You fanatics gonna cause it just to prove it
is92yqt,RebelPoetically,y3hgp6,"“Fanatics” 

This is an attack of character and logical fallacy. 

Furthermore, you said ,” I can read”

And you said,” it’s 2,000 years late”

How can you read when God makes it clear that Israel needed to be a nation again for the end times to start? 2,000 years ago Israel was still captive and in chains. This is a fact proven historically and even in more ways. 

Even during WWII and WWIII, Israel, was not a nation.

I think it’s clear you’re just intellectually dishonest and refuse to admit that God’s word’s spoke about this time period objectively. If you can’t even admit and speak about these things honestly I see no reason for either of us to ever speak to each other again about any topic. 

I mean, if you’re this dishonest about this topic, you may lie to me about any topic regardless of what it is, even scientific topics. 

So for my sake, I shouldn’t hear anything else you ever say because of that threat and concern.

So you tell me, if this is the case, why the next thing you say i should care to read and consider? I apologize for presuming you had knowledge on this issue though, my mistake."

is94dso,RebelPoetically,y3hgp6,"My statement’s are logical.

Here is the definition of logic; 

“The word ""logic"" originates from the Greek word ""logos"", which has a variety of translations, such as reason, discourse, or language. Logic is traditionally defined as the study of the laws of thought or correct reasoning, and is usually understood in terms of inferences or arguments. “

- Wikipedia 

“Since logic is dependent upon reason, emotions are removed from this practice, which means the concept of logic relies solely on given data and valid correlations based on the governing principles presented. The goal of logic is to find reasonable conclusions based on the given information, but to make those conclusions, the person in question must ensure they are making valid arguments.

- Study.com

“Logic is the process of reasoning based on specific principles. From the Greek logos meaning “word,” logic is the study of the principles of reasoning–a set of premises that are examined and arranged so as to bring a conclusion.”

- Carm.org

You committed logical fallacies again, here is the definition of logical fallacy;

“A fallacy is the use of invalid or otherwise faulty reasoning, or ""wrong moves,"" in the construction of an argument, which may appear stronger than it really is if the fallacy is not spotted.” 

- Wikipedia 

“A logical fallacy is an error in reasoning that makes your argument less effective and convincing.”

- Freecodecamp.org 


“Logical fallacies are bogus modes of reasoning that can appear legitimate but in fact violate accepted rules of inference. Logical fallacies can be tricky. By masquerading as legitimate arguments, they can fool us into thinking that they are legitimate. But closer inspection reveals the critical flaw at the heart of any given logical fallacy. Such flaws are not always easily detected, especially in the heat of debate.”

- AcademicInfluence

itd8ynb,MashmallowRabbit,yaviy6,"Hi, I know what you suffer and I feel for you. Unfortunately that is the nature of OCD. I used to have similar problems when I was a teenager. They did got solved. I just prayed about them. I suppose also meditating and understanding the Bible also gave me some peace.

Here are some thoughts about your writing:

- We are all sinners, and we do sin very often. Don’t hit yourself too hard when you do. God has forgave you, you should try to forgive yourself too. It is NOT you who can avoid sinning and be more like Christ (No one can) but “for it is God who works in you to will and to act in order to fulfill his good purpose.”Philippians 2:13. Pray for that, that God may transform you and keep you away from whatever you tend to sin with."
itdwzr1,Enough_Reception_313,yaviy6,I can sympathize with your struggle especially cuz I’ve gone through similar things. I am spiritually immature currently and so I can’t really point you to any scripture specifically that would help (sorry) but I can say that I’ve been someone who’s dealt with intrusive thoughts to the point where sin would cause me to overthink and dwell on the past making it hard to enjoy to life at all. I restricted myself at an unhealthy level from any enjoyment and it was really hard. Thankfully I found that prayer really helps and I’ve found massive improvement. I would love to pray for you as well if that’s ok but ya I would recommend trying to find scripture that would help and praying. God bless ❤️(sorry for the rambling😅)
itfbkhw,ReasonableDuck9302,yaviy6,"Hey guys OP here. My anxiety and ocd obviously hasn’t went away in such a short time. But I’m pleased to say I have gotten better. I had an anxiety attack 2 days ago and it shut me down. I’m about to eat a soft pretzel and have my first food in 2 days basically. My anxiety is still there but it’s better.

All of your kind words have meant a lot. I’m not perfect and will never be. But as long as I put faith into god who is perfect and trust in him everything will be alright. I may actually get up off the couch today and do something. I’ve been scared to eat and when I eat I wanna puke. Thankfully I’m going to ignore that feeling and eat and maybe even do some hobbies today. Like learning a new language and playing some football. And ofc I’m going to pray and read the Bible! I love you guys thank you for helping me with some troubles! God bless you all!"

iter9gy,External_Mountain_34,yaviy6,"You need to ignore the thoughts instead of paying them attention, and you need to debunk the fear that is driving the obsession. 

If you are remorseful about your sin, you are already predestined by God to be saved, because He is working inside you and your love of Him is absolute proof.
Stop worrying about not being saved, absolute must.

You need to just ignore the thoughts, then they will mostly go away."
iteyd8k,joe_biggs,yaviy6,"Boy, I understand completely. I also suffer from a form of OCD. Psychiatrists call it “pure O”. It is the obsessive without so much compulsion. I too obsess over sinning and I am constantly feeling as if I had just done something wrong. I think about things that happened so many years ago and feel guilt or feel as if it’s still something I haven’t been forgiven for doing. Of course that’s ridiculous, but that’s how my brain works. I pray every day and every night and I came to a realization that this is the way God made me. I know that we are here on earth to learn Lessons from our experiences and from other peoples experiences. Our existence here is over in a blink. I was once told by Deacon that if I didn’t know where I was going that I was in trouble. That worried me beyond words. After years I thought to myself, how can anyone really know where they are going? I mean I believe I will see the Lord and I believe that the Lord forgives us as many times as we need forgiving. I’m paraphrasing this, but Jesus said “if someone comes to you and asks for forgiveness seven times you will forgive them seven times.” I think the number seven has significance, I dare to think that he would have said 1000 times. I don’t think seven times is actually the limit. I too sin, and several times a day sometimes. Every night I speak to the Lord and ask for forgiveness as I am truly sorry for disappointing Him. anyway, before this reply becomes a novel I would just say that if you have prescriptions, take them. This is not a sin to take medication that has been prescribed to you for a condition like this. I have prescriptions and they do help. God does and will use doctors to help heal us. Some people don’t believe that, but I know it to be true. God helps us in ways we can’t even imagine. I am middle-aged and have been dealing with this my entire life. If you ever need to talk please feel free. God bless you and heal you!"
itga292,alan65011,yaviy6,I would say that the intrusive thoughts are Satan trying to destroy your relationship with Jesus. The Bible warns that the battles we face are spiritual in nature and that is why we are to put on the armor of God. You need to let Jesus embrace you with the peace that surpasses understanding as you continue to abide in obedience to Him. Jesus already defeated Satan so know when you get these intrusive thoughts that it's the enemy trying to convince of the lie that you don't belong to Father God. Replace these thoughts with lovely thoughts of your Savior Jesus Christ or immediately start praying for loved ones. Weaken the enemy's power! He wants you in anxiety and unrest!

itcxi35,Tree_Of_Life_Wisdom,yatmc8,"Understanding is the way out. This is easier said then done of course, but I am a living proof it can be done. Here is what I mean. There are some things that you simply do without thinking. Why? Because you truly understand them so there literally is nothing left to think about. For example:  brushing your teeth or taking a bath. No thought required. The same is true even about deep life meanings. Once you understand truly you can simply get on with it and your head is quiet all the time.

Here is a metaphor from me to you.

Imagine a sunny sky with bright white clouds. You are the blue sky. God is the sun. The white clouds are your thoughts. A sky will always have some clouds in it, it’s natural. Sometimes the clouds become so overwhelming they block the sun. But the sun does not go away. It’s still there behind the clouds. There is nothing to do to fight the clouds or deal with the clouds. They come and go. But through understanding you sort of move to a part of the world where it hardly ever storms and you spend almost all the time in bright sunny skies."
itd12rx,RationalThoughtMedia,yatmc8,"First. Take a breath. I will be praying for you. 

To answer your question of what could help. Capture every one of these thoughts and hand them in prayer seeking an escape from them and God's will for you. I say this because Spiritual Warfare is real. The enemy will use your OCD against you. And it seems that is exactly what is happening. 

Second thing. Since you are having difficulty with reading the Bible. Take up an online Bible study where someone goes through verse by verse. This way you can understand the meanings of truth about what may trigger your concerns. I could recommend if you like. 

Always remember God is not the author of confusion. And learning the Bible through a Bible study will give you wisdom to test every thought or concern against scripture to know if it is from God. 

Finally. Getting professional help is not a bad thing. Neither is medication. If you are going to get help maybe to help settle yourself in doing so find a Christian therapist."
itctn36,ReasonableDuck9302,yatmc8,"OP here. For some more context to how bad my OCD is to help people understand how annoying it is. Plus I’m 17 so I struggle with silly young person problems too.

It’s like a war in my head 24/7. It prevents me from functioning and living. Sometimes I wonder if therapy and medication are sinful etc. I’m constantly worrying even though IK Im saved through THE LORD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST. I just had a bad panic attack yesterday that shut me down all day into today. I just had another one like 2 hours ago. It had me say things I regret and I have asked god to forgive me and I have repented. IK I’m not ever capable of being perfect because only god is perfect and us humans are flawed. But I want to live my life and not worry 24/7. 

I have prayed and asked god to cure my anxiety and I’ve gotten better with it yet I still struggle so much. Please just I need some advice!"

Maybe it is spiritual warfare but I’m most certain it’s ocd because I used to shut down the same way before I was a Christian. I haven’t read much of the Bible I’m reading 30 mins a day now don’t worry :)
So I have no idea about spiritual warfare. I believe everything in the Bible to be true. 

And when I say issues with reading the Bible, I mean when i see or hear anything about religion I began to have ocd panic attacks. So it’s just scary sometimes."

ird5gsq,Randomstufongodnocap,xxl1rx,"If you wouldn't accept $1 off of your list price I would try listing your item for more. If you listed for $7/$8 but received an offer of $4 you'd take it correct? 

I get buyers don't take into consideration the fees. But what's important as a seller is to realize is that potential buyers have to not only pay for the item, but also pay sales tax and shipping most of the time. You accepting $3 is you making $2.31. But the customer actually paid probably around $10 depending on shipping. 

So to those sellers everywhere here is some advise, expect people to haggle. For these marketplaces, listing rarely sell for what your asking for. List your item 5-20% above what you really want to make from your items. Sometimes you'll end up making more money than you thought, and have a happy customer who thinks they got a good deal"

I would talk to them and they will comply for a while and then back to being Noisy. That alone was frustrating because you felt like they were walking all over you. Finally they got better after other neighbors complain but then they would start doing petty things like throw trash, dog shit and what have you.

The problem with retaliating is you have to live next to these people. Am I upset, of course but I realize I am stuck and I used to get very angry but you realize it probably took them all of 2 seconds to throw that trash and it is not worth my time obsessing about them. They are inconsiderate asshats and I made the mistake talking to them about the garbage.

Your situation might be different but if it is petty small stuff then it is not worth your time to escalate. If they are breaking my property, of course get help but small petty stuff no one would care. Also my NFH has significantly improved on the noise so if I retaliate I am pretty sure they will be blasting their music again.

In OP cases she does not feel comfortable because asshats next door is doing it exactly in retaliation. OP dont let them get to you too much. You have every right to be upset but do not approach your neighbors. You can complain to the landlord and maybe get cameras. You could also be silly and put something nasty on their door handle.

Your story, your testimony may be the necessary key to help others in similar situations that cannot see hope in another day. He allowed Job to endure great illness and loss, He allowed Daniel to be put in the Lions den, and Paul to spend along time in prison. And yet they're stories are what help us follow to Him!

iqcmfm8,Pyrolilly,xqyfyb,"Sorry for the wall of text, on mobile. I am so so sorry you've had to go through that. I've actually gone through very similar things, and please don't beat yourself up for not doing great at school with this kind of stress. You have to have the very basics met of feeling safe and getting some sleep before you can learn. I don't know if you're in high school or living with your mom in that apartment. I don't know what country you're in, but in the US I've broken a lease because we were not safe there (document and record everything first) without it going on our credit or owing. There are shelters for parents with kids who are getting away from domestic violence. I know it's very very hard to find a place but ask for help and check any resources you can. See if you can take a semester off school. I'm serious. Do NOT wreck your hearing with the volume up that loud. Get the wax swimmer's earplugs from the store and use those - not foam ones. Do not engage with the neighbors. Just keep calling the cops and reporting them until they're gone. And if you're safe in your car, absolutely go in the car to have a vacation and get away for a few hours. I also asked God why He was letting this happen when I was at the stage you're at. It was a nightmare. We lived through it and are in a much better place in life now, but I will be honest that it took a long time and there is some PTSD now anytime a neighbor plays base. Therapy is fantastic and can heal many things. Don't lose faith. You are not alone. He still loves you and will get you through all of this. Pray for His strength, safety, and peace, and how to forgive the horrible people. It helps when you can see them through God's eyes and how lost they are and feel sorry for them. You can also be angry and frustrated, I'm just saying that part helps. You are fighting a war so do what you need to do and take care of yourself. Pray for resources - maybe someone from a church or school has a spare room for a while until the jerks are actually evicted - that can take a long time. I don't know God's plan in this but cling to His words and talk to some pastors. I will be praying for you. Hang in there. This sucks and is not fair, but it will not last forever. I know getting through the next hour can feel impossible so take it an hour at a time if you have to. It's ok. Hugs friend."

I tried to call the police on a lot of occasions but they don’t answer the door for them then blast it louder if not already at 100, or if it’s already at 100 they start banging and being obnoxious.

ite2wbq,HonestGodQuestions,yb15f2,"There are Saints in Orthodoxy who practiced a very specific form of piety called being a fool for Christ. They lived lives where they intentionally acted as if they were either insane or unintelligent, and did things that provoked ridicule, for the purposes of humility and keeping their devotion to God a secret and unknown to the world, so that they might not be tempted to pride. 

I'm not suggesting that this lifestyle be adopted by people, of course, but I think reading about their lives, and offering them veneration and asking for their intercessions on our behalf would be an excellent way to keep ourselves from idolizing our own intelligence and thinking too highly of ourselves."
ite4w5u,Tree_Of_Life_Wisdom,yb15f2,Jesus’ parable of the seeds that fell along the ground addresses this topic. Intelligent learning is actually a barrier between man and understanding. Intelligent knowledge must be practiced and applied. It is useful for skill building but is not useful for understanding. Understanding is more experiential and intuitive. It’s about seeing. The truth only needs to be seen and once it is seen it’s understood.
itesav5,Christi_Reventi,yb15f2,"When a love of knowledge becomes greater than one's love of bringing life to others, knowledge becomes either useless or abusive.

Knowledge is a wonderful thing when we use it to effectively show love to others.  

If I give my grandma my favorite toy car, she knows I love her, but, I haven't really benefited either of us.  When we have that sacrificial love combined with knowledge and power, we can do great things.  That's what knowledge is for.  It's a tool to help us love better.  

Did you ever see the video where the dog is desperately trying to save some fish by splashing water on them?  How did he know to do that?  What good is his concern and his knowledge without the power of the people who were better equipped to help the fish?  In the same way, we need the power of God behind us to accomplish the works of God.  The power of God is love.  He is there to back us up when we want to help someone in need whether in word or in deed."
iteupb7,loveandsonship,yb15f2,By recognizing an equal measure of knowledge and intelligence in everyone.
itg94ow,SkovandOfMitaze,yb15f2,"I don’t think people are idolizing intelligence. People are seeing the benefits of wisdom. In reality the opposite is true. We see stupidity being glorified. I made a thread about why diversity is important, and why it’s good to not just read books on theology, or any subject, by people who look like you and the majority got upset. A bunch of white people , and in white too, got mad that I suggested reading theology books by black peoples, Japanese people and Christians with different views… that upset then. They would rather ignore the marginalized and continue with their colonists mentality.  Or they wear it as a badge to ignore what scientists have to teach.

It’s not hard to tell most peoples race based on how they treat the subject. But you are right. I don’t listen to people who don’t read posts, make comments that are already answered and throw out things like “ hope I find Jesus “ and so on. I read almost everyone’s first 2-3 posts on my posts, and I respond to them. That means I listen… I have to understand their post to ask questions  about it or respond to it. 

So , on this post, I read it and understood it. I then countered that I don’t think intelligence is actually being idolized by anyone. 

So I linked it to my experiences in here. One of those experiences is where I made a post that said it’s important to not get stuck in a echo chamber. It’s important to give everyone a chance. It’s important to listen to what theologians and biblical scholars from all genders, nationalities, ethnicities and cultures have to say. That it’s not healthy to just listen to and read theology by those who look and think about you. Then tons of people got mad. 

They would counter with something like “ I don’t care if someone is black I just read good theology “ and so I said yeah… I agree… but that’s not what the post is about right? The post is about white it’s important to look at theology from other races…. It’s not a trick question. 

You either think it’s important to hear diverse thoughts or you don’t. After someone tells me they don’t repeatedly, I stop listening to them. Just like if you respond to this saying the same thing again, I’ll know it’s not worth reading what you wrote. I don’t need to hear the same opinion by the same person three times. Once is good. Twice is clarifying. Three times is just stupid.  It’s a circle of dumbness. 

Take your name. 
Scriptures, not feelings. You’re inferring that you somehow have this emotionless, non biased reading of the Bible and anyone who reads it differently are using feelings. So let’s say you are white. Are you?  If you’re white, and you are straight, and you are a Republican, and you are an American, and you’re a guy and you say , “ I’m reading theology perfectly without and biased opinions or feelings “ and these other straight white American men agree with me, and all the books and podcasts you listen to on theology is backed by the same adjectives, it’s a echo chamber. 

Conservative theology ignores the scholarly work by the marginalized. 

So I’m a straight white American guy. I don’t make fun of straight white American guys because of their adjectives. I don’t hate myself, my race, my country and ect… I served in the army for my country and I do tons of volunteer work for my country snd 70% of everything I read and wrote in theology comes from white American men. The issue is not white American men. The issue is when you’re a white American guy who only listened to other white American guys and think you’re not biased because all the other white American guys agree and the black, Asian, Hispanic, women, immigrant, and so on people that disagree with you are going off of emotions."

Finally got her to shut up and put a pole in for her to ""charge up her RV pad"" and then use 50 amp tails to connect to the shed.

Yes. I hate logbait, and its destroying the game. Please stop shiting on hog 2.6, its similarly defensive as logbait, and dont tell me the hog cannot be defended, i just know that a rocket is around 1 hog hit and you really cant defend it neither. 

Not just classic logbait with rocket is shit, there are so many other variations.

Some classic annoying ones include:

Classic - Catch da princess. Legit stop everything with knight + inferno. And then rebuild your tower from rocket damage

Dart valk - Always highly concentrated to defend that BROKEN DART GOBLIN (and see your troops being melt down by that broken troop bcs you holding on to the log)

Megabait - Ok megabait, ok. One most toxic card with the most annoying deck wowa

Skarmy bait - YOWZERS! melt troops down with skarmy bcs they holding on that stupid log! yowzers! 

EBARBS BAIT - something that i LITERALLY SEE. sometimes even EBARBS MEGAKNIGHT BAIT. Retarded as f\*ck 

All these, especially megaknight, as long as they tank for their goblin barrel, even if you can defend the megaknight goblins can take your tower.

irxnr6v,Cantdie27,y1ia4t,"It's an incredibly long and complicated story. To sum it up briefly I had a perfect storm of multiple events occurring externally and internally. One of these events was a situation I was in that I was finding incredibly intolerable. I wanted out of this situation. In order to get out I had to make a choice to purge my fear of consequence. The moment I made that choice it was like a door in my mind was unlocked and Jesus was on the other side to meet me.

The experience was so surreal. I could actually physically feel love overflowing out of me and surrounding me. It was the most blissful thing I ever felt. I don't know if it was some kind of chemical reaction that caused the release of a bunch of carbon and that was the physical substance I felt surrounding me or what, but I swear on my life I lost 30 to 40 pounds in a few days.

One time, I was visiting my wife's childhood home. In the back yard, there's this silver maple that's been there since before she was born. When my mother-in-law started in on one of her rants, I went outside and sat beneath that maple. I started to meditate. 

I had a feeling of 'melting' into the tree and I began to see, from a perspective somewhere in the branches, scenes with children that looked like younger versions of my wife and brothers-in-law playing in the yard beneath it. Climbing up the tree, playing tag around it. Bouncing on a trampoline that was no longer there.

I spoke to my wife about the experience and what I saw on the drive back home. I gave her all the details I could remember, even clothes. She confirmed the details. 

I've also had contact with my gods since then. But that incident was perhaps the first that pushed me onto my path. It's why I hold animist views, and my current polytheism is fundamentally nothing more than an extension of my animism."

In my practice I have gone to the spirit realm and even met some of the Gods there, and spoken with them. I regularly do divination in my practice and I have these all the time, so there's always some little things that I encounter on the regular. Asking for confirmation from a deity and getting a reading that literally uses that deity's name or symbol, getting direct and relevant responses, and readings that I don't understand but which the person I'm doing it for does. It's allowed me to be there for people regardless of where they are in life. 

Other times it's not been my personal experience but ones I've shared with the community. Attributes of certain deities which were directly experienced by others as well, despite what we experienced being different than the resources on the subject. On the other end I've also seen individual and eventually shared experiences of a deity eventually leading to discovery of new information that confirms an ancient basis for that belief as well.

It took only a few weeks of looking to find it.

The TL;DR is that the *Gospel of Thomas* (""good news of the twin"") appears to have been incorporating a number of ideas at the time (Lucretius, the Socratic dialogues, Orphism, Judaism) to end up with the following concepts:

There was an original humanity in a universe that wasn't designed, but was the result of natural laws and natural selection. From this world an original humanity eventually developed.

This original humanity brought forth a creator within light.

That original world and humanity is now dead, and the still living creator of light couldn't save their souls which depended on physical bodies.

Instead, it recreated the entire world before it, and fashioned itself into twins of what existed, including the humans, which are both it and its children at the same time, born a second time into its kingdom.

The document and tradition claims we are its children, that we are greater than the original humanity if only we realize the nature of our existence, and that those who fully understand what it says should not fear death. And that everything around us is just that creator's light made to seem like a physical world.

While I can understand why at the time it was only seen as one random belief system among many, in an age where its ideas of quantized matter (like digitizing an analog source) and natural selection have proven true, when we are on the verge of creating a new non-human intelligence [literally in light](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/5.0040567), are using intelligence like that to power more and more ""digital twins,"" and only rediscovered that text within days of the world's first digital computer being turned on, I have great difficulty in dismissing it as a mere coincidence."
irynr96,mirta000,y1ia4t,"At the age of 25, I had a lot of life transformational events that made me think ""fuck it, life is short, let me try what I discounted as irrational"".

The period of ""before"" and ""after"" is like looking at two different me's, as I started working on myself and changing my attitude to how I see the world.

So was it something that I experienced? Yes. But it was rather organic and not jarring I guess? Like when people say ""experiences"" one would think I full blown hallucination, or a paranormal phenomena right in front of them, while for me it was more gentle."

that is not to say i can affirm any religion is accurate.   
  
all i can say is that none of my experiences have been while i was intoxicated in any way or at any time my health physical or mental was suspect, half of my experiences may be un believable and un explainable coincidence,but the other half were un explainable by any other means ( other then supernatural) witnessed events."

When we visited her grandmother a few weeks ago, she spent maybe an hour just reminiscing and showing me pictures. She visits her family frequently, even though I usually can't join her. One of the advantages of getting weekends off, I suppose.

Last time I visited her grandmother's house, I didn't go in. We had a funeral and burial for our cat in the backyard. Our visit a few weeks ago was the first time I had actually properly visited in a few years. Her grandmother didn't recognize me.

She continued the tradition, in a way. She was constantly taking pictures of our cat. She had pictures of him from when he was a wee kitten up until the week he died. 

I don't like getting my picture taken, so she doesn't do it as often to me. She usually asks me permission. She had the idea of taking a picture of me each month as I progressed through my transition. We got to month 3 before I stopped because I was discouraged with the slow progress.
