You owe it to yourself to ask why.

Then Azariah stood and offered this prayer; in the midst of the fire he opened his mouth and said: 
[3] ""Blessed art thou, O Lord, God of our fathers,
and worthy of praise;
and thy name is glorified for ever.
[4] For thou art just in all that thou hast done to us,
and all thy works are true and thy ways right,
and all thy judgments are truth.
[5] Thou hast executed true judgments in all that
thou hast brought upon us
and upon Jerusalem, the holy city of our fathers,
for in truth and justice thou hast brought
all this upon us because of our sins.
[6] For we have sinfully and lawlessly departed from thee,
and have sinned in all things and have not
obeyed thy commandments;
[7] we have not observed them or done them,
as thou hast commanded us that it might go well with us.
[8] So all that thou hast brought upon us,
and all that thou hast done to us,
thou hast done in true judgment.
[9] Thou hast given us into the hands of lawless
enemies, most hateful rebels,
and to an unjust king, the most wicked in all the world.
[10] And now we cannot open our mouths;
shame and disgrace have befallen thy servants and worshipers.
[11] For thy name's sake do not give us up utterly,
and do not break thy covenant,
[12] and do not withdraw thy mercy from us,
for the sake of Abraham thy beloved
and for the sake of Isaac thy servant
and Israel thy holy one,
[13] to whom thou didst promise
to make their descendants as many as the stars of heaven
and as the sand on the shore of the sea.
[14] For we, O Lord, have become fewer than any nation,
and are brought low this day in all the world
because of our sins.
[15] And at this time there is no prince, or prophet, or leader,
no burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense,
no place to make an offering before thee or to find mercy.
[16] Yet with a contrite heart and a humble spirit
may we be accepted,
as though it were with burnt offerings of rams and bulls,
and with tens of thousands of fat lambs;
[17] such may our sacrifice be in thy sight this day,
and may we wholly follow thee,
for there will be no shame for those who trust in thee.
[18] And now with all our heart we follow thee,
we fear thee and seek thy face.
[19] Do not put us to shame,
but deal with us in thy forbearance
and in thy abundant mercy.
[20] Deliver us in accordance with thy marvelous works,
and give glory to thy name, O Lord!
Let all who do harm to thy servants be put to shame;
[21] let them be disgraced and deprived of all power and dominion,
and let their strength be broken.
[22] Let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God,
glorious over the whole world.""",True

Saint Maximilian was the son of the Ephesus city administrator, and the other six youths were sons of illustrious citizens of Ephesus. The youths were friends from childhood, and all were in military service together.

When the emperor Decius (249-251) arrived in Ephesus, he commanded all the citizens to offer sacrifice to the pagan gods. Torture and death awaited anyone who disobeyed. The seven youths were denounced by informants, and were summoned to reply to the charges. Appearing before the emperor, the young men confessed their faith in Christ.

Their military belts and insignia were quickly taken from them. Decius permitted them to go free, however, hoping that they would change their minds while he was off on a military campaign. The youths fled from the city and hid in a cave on Mount Ochlon, where they passed their time in prayer, preparing for martyrdom.

The youngest of them, Saint Iamblicus, dressed as a beggar and went into the city to buy bread. On one of his excursions into the city, he heard that the emperor had returned and was looking for them. Saint Maximilian urged his companions to come out of the cave and present themselves for trial.

Learning where the young men were hidden, the emperor ordered that the entrance of the cave be sealed with stones so that the saints would perish from hunger and thirst. Two of the dignitaries at the blocked entrance to the cave were secret Christians. Desiring to preserve the memory of the saints, they placed in the cave a sealed container containing two metal plaques. On them were inscribed the names of the seven youths and the details of their suffering and death.

The Lord placed the youths into a miraculous sleep lasting almost two centuries. In the meantime, the persecutions against Christians had ceased. During the reign of the holy emperor Theodosius the Younger (408-450) there were heretics who denied that there would be a general resurrection of the dead at the Second Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. Some of them said, ‚ÄúHow can there be a resurrection of the dead when there will be neither soul nor body, since they are disintegrated?‚Äù Others affirmed, ‚ÄúThe souls alone will have a restoration, since it would be impossible for bodies to arise and live after a thousand years, when even their dust would not remain.‚Äù Therefore, the Lord revealed the mystery of the Resurrection of the Dead and of the future life through His seven saints.

The owner of the land on which Mount Ochlon was situated, discovered the stone construction, and his workers opened up the entrance to the cave. The Lord had kept the youths alive, and they awoke from their sleep, unaware that almost two hundred years had passed. Their bodies and clothing were completely undecayed.

Preparing to accept torture, the youths once again asked Saint Iamblicus to buy bread for them in the city. Going toward the city, the youth was astonished to see a cross on the gates. Hearing the name of Jesus Christ freely spoken, he began to doubt that he was approaching his own city.

When he paid for the bread, Iamblicus gave the merchant coins with the image of the emperor Decius on it. He was detained, as someone who might be concealing a horde of old money. They took Saint Iamblicus to the city administrator, who also happened to be the Bishop of Ephesus. Hearing the bewildering answers of the young man, the bishop perceived that God was revealing some sort of mystery through him, and went with other people to the cave.

At the entrance to the cave the bishop found the sealed container and opened it. He read upon the metal plaques the names of the seven youths and the details of the sealing of the cave on the orders of the emperor Decius. Going into the cave and seeing the saints alive, everyone rejoiced and perceived that the Lord, by waking them from their long sleep, was demonstrating to the Church the mystery of the Resurrection of the Dead.

Soon the emperor himself arrived in Ephesus and spoke with the young men in the cave. Then the holy youths, in sight of everyone, lay their heads upon the ground and fell asleep again, this time until the General Resurrection.

The emperor wanted to place each of the youths into a jeweled coffin, but they appeared to him in a dream and said that their bodies were to be left upon the ground in the cave. In the twelfth century the Russian pilgrim Igumen Daniel saw the holy relics of the seven youths in the cave.

There is a second commemoration of the seven youths on October 22. According to one tradition, which entered into the Russian Prologue (of Saints‚Äô Lives), the youths fell asleep for the second time on this day. The Greek Menaion of 1870 says that they first fell asleep on August 4, and woke up on October 22.

There is a prayer of the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus in the Great Book of Needs (Trebnik) for those who are ill and cannot sleep. The Seven Sleepers are also mentioned in the service for the Church New Year, September 1.

It attacks my religion and it makes it very hard to be a Christian at times. It causes me so much stress I don‚Äôt know what to do. I truly love god and accept Jesus as my lord and my savior, yet I look at things out of fear of going to hell and always am worried if I‚Äôm sinning or not.

For some backstory, I had bad anxiety about death in November of 2020. It went away after a couple days, but came back badly in late December 2020. I decided to accept Jesus as my lord and my savior around that time and I had a fire for Jesus for a long time. Until some point in fall of 2021 I stopped reading the Bible and fell back into sin and would pray and try to stop but I would sin again and again. Thankfully I never gave up and continued believing and finally got my act together and I have been reading the Bible 30 mins a day and praying more often. Sometimes I pray multiple times a day!!! But when I read the Bible it triggers my ocd or even when I see anything about religion or death.

My intrusive thoughts try to get me to leave the religion and say awful things. So naturally I fight the thoughts. But then that actually causes ppl with ocd to panic and then have a panic attack. Fighting the thoughts is actually worse for you.

I‚Äôm not perfect, only God is perfect. God is so perfect that when he was in a human body Jesus was still PERFECT. 

Any advice on how to not listen to my intrusive thoughts? Because it‚Äôs getting to the point I have trouble reading the Bible. Religion should bring me joy not pain. So any advice on to ignore my thoughts? Because when I ignore them I worry if I left the faith and I worry if I just do all this out of fear etc‚Ä¶ How as a Christian can I look at these thoughts and know they aren‚Äôt true and remember that Jesus is the truth.

I‚Äôve tried to look up sermons on this but can‚Äôt seem to find any? Maybe I‚Äôm typing questions in wrongly do you know any sermons on this? 

This is something I‚Äôve thought about quite a lot in the past. It‚Äôs gotten to the point I just try to ignore it because I can‚Äôt seem to find many answers on it. Believers have told me it‚Äôs because your on the ‚ÄúNarrow path‚Äù but has the narrow path ever felt maybe like it‚Äôs not working out in modern society? Is there ever a degree where you have to kinda be worldly to make it in our modern society now? 

I‚Äôve gotten some questions asking why I‚Äôm multi denominational but it‚Äôs actually from the answers of other believers ‚Äúmany believers have said you just need to find a Church with your age range‚Äù so I did what they said and you know what happened it‚Äôs made me look into many denominations and churches now and for some reason it seems my age range still isn‚Äôt found? It seems like where scattered because of how many divisions there are denominationally? That people my age because of the way we are grouped publicly in most cases through schooling of our upbringing. That it seems a lot of people my age find more comfort In relatability in age and common interests now then faith? I‚Äôve been observing for many years now people my age seem to find more trust in people with common interests then even people in the Church? 

I understand that there is the Sabbath that we worship that most people choose 1 day a week to do so. But I‚Äôm starting to feel like a sense people my age devote so much time the rest of the week to not doing that and because of unintentional instant gratifications from technology I‚Äôm feeling a sense that people my age find Church unimportant? They drive past so many empty churches most the week that maybe it unintentionally makes them feel that way? It makes me wonder and ponder about how Churches where like when we didn‚Äôt have cars or fast transportation maybe they where more of community hubs? 

What I‚Äôm also observing is that it seems so many hearts are growing cold in the faith because people observe others on ‚Äúhigher positions of leadership in there work or hobbies or jobs that seem to ‚Äúnot need God‚Äù sometimes bash God all together yet there continuing to advance,  prosper and thrive? Or because people can make incomes and entire livings off of things the Church deems as wrong? 

Can Christianity ever effect your life maybe in a negative way say if you lived in a society where a majority started to have very negative perceptions on the faith? What if this effected things outside your faith by you glorifying and proclaiming the gospel? 

Ultimately God is in control even if things don‚Äôt seem like there working out or it‚Äôs very confusing?

My last and only friend left me. The only things she says now are just to retain her status of feeling like a good person. I know she doesn‚Äôt want to hear from me ever again and doesn‚Äôt really care about me.

I just don‚Äôt see a point in continuing any longer. I lost my best friend and girlfriend, every other friend, everybody else, and now the one I thought wouldn‚Äôt.
