And I love how whenever I ask God something, He gives me answers quickly. When I was crying out, He told me it was difficult because I removed Him from the situation.

And it made sense. The whole time I felt like I was doing it for *me* and not for him. I never disciplined myself when it came to masturbation, and I don’t think I really even went to God about it.

Today I can say that I had a few temptations, but it felt easier to resist them.

I know cause I've been there. When I was a small child I went to Heaven and spent time with God and Jesus. This was before I went to school or knew anything about religion, so it couldn't have been my brain projecting. One night my soul left my body. I was extremely confused and was looking down at my human body. I found myself being pulled up and up until I was above my house looking down, I then went further up and went into a dark tunnel where I went through fast. I then found myself standing in a field beside Jesus and there were blue skies. Jesus took my hand and led me through Heaven to me to the throne of God. God was enormous and sat on a large throne. Beside God were men/beings in long robes, i cant really remember, maybe angels or prophets? Jesus then left me with God, when Jesus was leaving God said, ""My son is very busy and I am so proud of him"". I sat on God's lap and he showed me the world like how you would see it from space and was zooming up on people praying for example kneeling by their bed. He said that its really important to pray, thats how we can communicate with him. He said that he will help us, but we have to ask him for help. Im sure there was more he said, but this is all I can remember. I was then put back in my body.

What does God look like? He had long silver hair and a long beard and was kind of oldish looking. He looked like father time. His eyes were full of wisdom and love. He was all knowing and beyond goodness. 

From meeting God, I could sense he really loves humans. Genuinely. He really cares about his children. We are all children of him. He really stressed the importance of prayer. You don't have to be in a church or anything, just clasping your hands together and talking to God is enough. He wants to help but he wants you to acknowledge him also. He really loves all creation. 

Heaven is beautiful. Heaven is peace. I want everything alive to go there. I want every single person and animal to be there with me someday soon. Earth is difficult. We deserve to go home.

yb16v1,Status-Air4862,TrueChristian,LGBTQ+ sex and marriage,"Sex is for between a husband and wife. The true and only purpose of sex is for procreation of humans. Anything other than that falls outside the realm of Gods wish for your soul. If you happen to be LGBTQ+, it is God's wish that you abstain from sexual relations, because you are subverting the true purpose and meaning of sexual relations. It is God's wish that you do as Jesus did and pick up your cross and carry it. God is not angry with those who have sinned sexually, God loves you so so much. He just wants you to stop and honour his plan for Earth. Sex is for making humans. That's is its natural purpose. There is no hatred or judgement with God, only his rules, but if we know them, we must abide by them or else we are denying our soul and therefore denying God. Following on from that, an LGBTQ+ marriage isn't a true marriage in the eyes of God.

The bottom line is that LGBTQ+ sex and marriage are sins. God loves LGBTQ+ people SO MUCH, because they have a bigger battle to fight, but I promise you, abstaining is a much more spiritually fulfilling and wonderous than participating. 

Trust me I know, I am a lesbian. But I believe that LGBTQ+ lifestyles are a sin in the eyes of our loving and merciful God.

xrj0xo,NoCommunication7,helicopterparents,Do your parents ever infantilize you or even try to claim your disabled mentally or physically in front of other people?,"Long story made short, my parents once called someone out to our property and i was standing behind their car (parked, not running, handbrake on) on our drive doing something, there was a gate which was also closed, you get it, two obstacles that only a complete crackhead would ram through, they were just getting something out of the car (i'm good at reading body language and it was obvious they didn't want to go anywhere) and i was going to ask them if they wanted to move and if they wanted the gate open and me out of the way, also no grade so there was no chance of the car rolling if the brake failed and the engine was not running so no chance of one of those freak accidents where the car won't stop, also the obvious, i was quite far behind the car and i have a functioning brain, i can tell when a vehicle is moving towards me and i can move accordingly.

&#x200B;

But as i was just going to ask her if she needed me to move or the gate open, my mother appears out of nowhere and says in her helicopter voice (it's an odd voice, not shouting but there's a sense of urgency to it, a sort of 'listen or something bad will happen') 'can you walk over there, can you stay over there' i'm like 'what's the matter?' and she just says 'just stay over there'

&#x200B;

My mother later said 'she was going to take off' i had to explain to her that it was a car, not an airplane, thus not capable of 'taking off' (she uses werid slang like this, and it's always a one off and never again, she called clothing 'gear' once) that the gate was closed and that she was clearly not going anywhere, and that i was going to ask her if she needed any help, i thought of apologizing to her about my mother acusing her of trying to run me over in front of her but the opportunity never showed itself.

Another time i was out shopping with my mother, and she forced me to take a lift (elevator) over a single floor, worth noting that i suffer from claustrophobia so i don't like lifts and i take stairs whenever it's possible, i also think that taking a lift for one floor when you can just take the stairs (which is also healthy excercise) is a genuine entitled lazy person move, i'm also good at taking the stairs, as anyone is sober, always use the handrail, step carefully onto each step and just generally look out for obstacles and other people, important because all stairs are slightly different, i've only had 1-2 accidents in my lifetime and it's either been my fault (not looking) or an obstacle, in short i'm very good at the stairs because it's mostly what i've done in my life, statistically not as safe as elevators but i know what i'm doing and what the dangers are, i've never had an accident on a public set of stairs, my mother on the other hand has fallen way more times then me and kind of scares me when she's taking the stairs, and she is the one who puts obstacles on them, doesn't use the handrail or has both hands occupied, big no no stuff for safe stair usage.

&#x200B;

But in this store my mother insisted on taking the lift because i'm 'unsafe on the stairs' i get in and thankfully it's a bigger one that doesn't trigger me as much, but she holds the door open for an older man to get in, and then once the lift started travelling, my mother starts telling this complete stranger how 'unsafe i am on the stairs' how 'bad my footing is on the stairs' i had to raise a counter argument about how unsafe my mother is on the stairs and i generally felt sorry for the man as he got caught up in this mess i call my life for a moment.

&#x200B;

Also she once made me take a handicap lift, it was a small one meant for one wheel chair user, you had to hold down a very low down button to make it move, and we were definitely overloading it, it was moving so slowly that she for once agreed to use the stairs (and no she wouldn't take the stairs herself because i would be more then 2 meters away from her), the worst thing was that the lift was only designed for wheel chair users, i'm kind of glad no body actually needed it, although if there was i would have just told them that my entitled mother made me take it because she claims i'm not fit enough to take the stairs.",15,0.86,0,/r/helicopterparents/comments/xrj0xo/do_your_parents_ever_infantilize_you_or_even_try/,2022-09-29 14:06:52,True

&#x200B;

All of these nestled between friends i've gotten to know quite well and people who wanted to bring a post into the private domain, nothing wrong about that, i also get people asking if i'm alright because my mental health got destroyed by the lockdowns.

&#x200B;

I told them i was from the UK and that that my life was screwed up and back then they were hinting at another lockdown (which did happen) they asked me what i lost and i said some of my favorite clothing stores, they got back saying that it's nothing compared to people losing their loved ones but sorry for your loss anyway.

&#x200B;

Then they asked if i was a student to which i said no, then they asked me why, i didn't want to go into it so i said i wouldn't bother explaining it as it's quite personal, they said 'Alright, just wanted to let you vent' twice, which was odd.

&#x200B;

Then we talked about my day, which was ordinary, then started moaning at reddits abysmal chat notifications back then to which they agreed.

Fast  forward to my pre-teens and i really wanted a suit jacket but it took  me a year and a quarter for me to tell them, they didn't care and i  developed my own style that still hasn't left me til this day, by the  time i was 15 i was wearing waistcoats and stuff, eventually i was  wearing three piece suits and outfits based on what i saw in movies set  in the edwardian era and prior, i thought that my parents didn't care  anymore about what i wore but that all changed one day when i was 16, i  told my dad i wanted a tailcoat and he basically said 'no your not  having one of those' and no matter what i said i couldn't do anything 'i  need one in time for winter' i had a really nice outfit in mind but i  fought and eventually gave up, but then december and we're visiting our  nan for christmas and she left the old movie channel on her TV, it  looked like it was set in the late victorian era and guess what i see?  lots of tailcoats, i needed to get that coat! i dreamed of it every  night and got in trouble once for enlisting my sister to get one, it  wasn't until lockdown and me threatening to throw myself off a cliff  that my parents finally let me have one.

What  do i do? is me to blame? are my parents to blame? more importantly how  do i get out this hole so i can have what i want? and what if my  suspicion is right? i'm in no position to move out at the moment and i  can't sneak stuff in.",1,1.0,0,/r/relationship_advice/comments/xpw7gt/how_do_i_stop_hiding_things_from_my_parents/,2022-09-27 16:29:04,True
xnyvxl,NoCommunication7,Advice,"My coat stand collapsed and my parents saw how many clothes i have, i'm not sure what to do now","It started when i recently bought a jacket that ended up not fitting me so i told my dad to put it on my coat rack and i'll have a think about selling it or getting it tailored, that's when i hear my dad and brother calling me, my dad had put the jacket on the coat stand and it ended up being the proverbial straw that broke the camels back, it 'went down like the twin towers' it had three legs like a tripod and all three had splayed out, i've been suspecting it was failing for a while now, i did suspect my dad or brother but both said the same, that simply putting the jacket on it was enough to make it collapse.

&#x200B;

The problem was when i walked in there it was a mess, my bed was covered in clothes and my brother was trying to bend the coat stand legs back, but that's when my dad said 'you're going to have to get rid of some of these clothes, which ones?' a lot of them are lucky thrift and outlet finds, things i don't think i'll be able to find again at the same price or size, my dad and brother start picking up stuff and messing it all up, i had only reorginized this coat stand near the beginning of this year, i had a single hanger just for country/celtic clothing, that must have weighed a few kilo on it's own, he picks up a greenwoods tweed blazer (not cheap!) from this after throwing off my favorite irish green jacket with shamrock pin and asks if i want to 'keep it or not' literally the only thing i had to deter him was MSRP, then he tries to throw out a black shirt i have, then he goes for a hanger of all waistcoats and asks if he can throw any of those out, i realized most were designer and said no, he tried to throw out another jacket i was planning to sell, then went for a fine worsted jacket, yea you get the point, during all of this my brother went for a linen waistcoat i had and threw it out the window, i couldn't stop him, luckily i didn't pay too much for it, problem is i'm not allowed to put it all back on the coat stand in case it collapses again, i'm going to stuff it all into a suitcase or bag and well, buy a new stand.

&#x200B;

But the bigger problem is now my dad has seen how many clothes i have and wants to throw them out, i don't know what to do, he might not let me buy more clothes now, should i really throw out a £100 blazer just to prove i'm ready to 'get rid of some of this stuff?' my dad also has a grudge against how i dress which doesn't help either, can i just keep all my clothes?",1,1.0,0,/r/Advice/comments/xnyvxl/my_coat_stand_collapsed_and_my_parents_saw_how/,2022-09-25 13:58:52,True

&#x200B;

2 : How many shops sell / how easy is it to buy an irish kilt over there? i know you have many shops selling traditional irish and celtic clothing, i've just been browsing their internet pages, i've found only a few based in dublin that sell them, one of which claimed to sell irish tartans but only had scottish tartans up

One teenager at the mall even mistook me for one of his classmates, it’s that bad. I’m just cursed with looking young and it freaking sucks ‘cause guys in my area want a dude who looks like “Daddy”. And it feels like I’m kinda stuck in this perpetual twink phase. Like last night. Me and this guy were chatting. I send him my facepic and he’s like “How old are U?” And I’m like “I’m 24”. And he says “Man you look 19. At least you’re aging slow”. 

And this isn’t the first time someone has said something like that. I sent this one guy a facepic and he said “I bet Chris Hansen’s gonna pop up right behind you when you show up.” I nearly deleted the app.

Him: Nice build

Me: Thanks. I could say the same for you. 

Him: *sends album* His face isn’t bad. He’s not drop dead gorgeous, but far from ugly. He has that “Daddy” look to him.

Him: I'm 40 years old. You look great. 

Me: On your profile it says 34. 

Him: *Stops sharing his album* I lied. 

Me: Why? *Stops sharing album* 

Him: Bc guys like you wouldn’t chat with me then. 

Me: I wouldn't have a problem with your age if you were just honest about it. You're not the first 40 year old I've had try to talk to me. 

Him: Doesn't mean you met them.

Me: Oh no I've met with a few dudes over 40. The last dude I met up with was 40. He was up front about it and I had no problems with his age. 

Him: I hope you two had a wonderful time

Me: It was ok. We didn't get sexual and he left early. So he wasn't really into it. I was planning on meeting up with a dude who said he was 34, but clearly looked 45. I asked for his address and he ghosted me. 

Him: Perhaps the 40 guy felt you weren't him

Me: I mean, I was the one who told him we wouldn't be getting sexual. We were just meeting up to talk and feel each other out. Why not go after guys your own age? 

Him: LOL so he left bc you told him you didn't want anything sexual.  Reasonable.

Bc they're ugly. Anyway you're young, cute, built, and hung.  Enjoy your 20s.  Good luck. 

Him: At least tell me how hung? 

Him: lol I don't even care at this point. Cutttte guy but going no where.

y4pe9p,PonderinLife,askgaybros,Just had 3 guys cancel on me 🙄,"Ok so, earlier this week I (24) was talking with 3 guys. 2 (22, and 24) of them were a couple off Grindr looking for a 3rd who would be the 2nd top in the relationship. He literally wanted a 3rd person to “go to the gym with, watch movies with, get head with, kiss, and share my boy with”. Usually I’m not one for open relationships but they seemed kinda hot and I figured I’d at least try it once. We were talking about meeting this Saturday ‘cause the top said they were free on the weekends and wanted to meet up. I asked for a time and he said “I suck at planning ahead lol”. Now I know that whenever someone says this, it’s a red flag and code for “I don’t wanna commit to anything”. 

Anyway. Last night I send a message this morning saying “Hey. We still on to meet Saturday?” I get a message - at 1 AM - saying “We’re going to Universal Studios 🤪🥳”. How TF do I respond to this? I’m pretty sure they knew what they were doing this weekend and just didn’t say anything. I did notice that when I asked to meet them at a coffee shop, they kinda ghosted me but were fine meeting up at their place. 

The 3rd guy was off tinder. 29. He seemed cool. We’d been talking the last couple of weeks. But haven’t met in person yet. So we start talking about when and where to meet up. He suggests some cafe’s at around 10 AM in his area. And he says “We should probably take 1 car. Parking is scarce in those areas. So either you ride in my car. Or I can ride in yours.” Now this guy already lives 30 minutes away from me. And I think it’s a little odd to jump in a strangers car on the first meet up (I’m trying to have some standards lol). And it just struck me as odd. 

So I tell him “If I’m being honest. I don’t feel comfortable taking 1 car for a first time meet up. 3rd or 4th sure. But I think for the first time meeting up we should take separate cars. What place do you think we should meet up at?” No response.

Recently graduated from college and moved to LA. With stable employment. Go to the gym 3-5 times a week. I’ve been told I look like a model (I was signed to modeling agency as well). I have my own place (they call it a luxury apartment) with no roommate. I’ve been trying to get out my comfort zone. I’ve been trying to tell myself that I’m an attractive MF who has lots to offer. I’ve been trying to focus on myself and build myself up into the kind of guy I wanna be. 

But deep down I feel far from that. Tried my luck on the apps and nothing. And lately, whenever I’ve been sending out face pics, guys ghost me or flat out block me. And it makes me feel like I’m so ugly that I need surgery. ‘Cause this always happens. Guys will tell me “Oh you’re handsome.” Or “Oh you’re cute”. And then ghost me. So am I actually attractive or? ‘Cause they’re ok with my body but not my face. And I wonder why my face isn’t doing it for them. 

Sometimes it’s not even my face. I was talking to this guy last night. He’s like “We should hang out”. Then like 10 minutes later he’s like “You seem like a nice guy. But I don’t think we’re a match.” TF? And whenever I do try to make plans to meet up with guys, they always fall through. Or guys are always “busy”. Or they just ghost me. I can host, or travel. 

And what’s getting to me is seeing everyone with a boyfriend. Or a partner. Or in a relationship. And they’re all attractive couples who seem to have everything. And I know apps aren’t the only way to meet people. I’m still planning on joining a few local interest groups. And trying to expand my social network. Trying to get out more. 

But I just feel like I’ll be alone forever. And it feels like I can’t a catch a break. I feel like I have something to offer but no one cares. Maybe I should just focus on myself a little more.

xo9gdq,PonderinLife,Christian,What does God say about giving up?,"I (24 Male), pretty much on the verge of giving up on 2 dreams. One of them was acting. And another was singing. I’ve just noticed that I’m at a new chapter of my life where none of those things are plausible. I’m working in a field that’s unrelated to those. 

I’ve also fallen out of love with those 2 dreams as well, despite my talent in both areas getting better. I’ve spent hours and hours on auditions, practicing my singing, money on coaches. I was very passionate about both of these. But now, not so much. I’m not really passionate about much. 

I’m just tired of being overlooked. No matter how many auditions I go out on. No matter how many songs and covers I record. It seems like someone else is always getting more likes and followers than me. Or someone’s always picked for the role over me, no matter how good I do in the audition. No matter how much effort I put in. I’ve been pursuing this since I was 10 years old. And it feels like God is calling me to live in the background. Live in the shadows. Like he doesn’t want me to be seen or heard. At all. 

The weird thing is, people have told me that my acting was inspiring. Or that seeing me act made them want to get into it. Or that I should have my own TV Show.  Or that I’ve got a “beautiful voice”. Or that I’ve got a wide vocal range. But that doesn’t mean anything to God I think. Why give me an ability that’s never meant to be seen or heard or appreciated. 

I know one sign God uses is doors closing/making one uncomfortable. Lately doors in this field have been closing left and right. My agent dropped me once I moved to Los Angeles. Even though my acting is getting better. My singing videos don’t get as many views as they used to. Even though I sound better than ever. But it seems like this isn’t the field that’s meant for me. And I think I’m ok with that. 

But, I started a new job recently and I seem to be excelling there, even though I only graduated in June. Doors seem to be opening left and right. It’s a regular 9-6 at a big company in the field I got my degree in. 

So I’m thinking this is God telling me to just give up acting and singing. Is this his sign to pursue a regular life with a regular job?",1,0.67,0,/r/Christian/comments/xo9gdq/what_does_god_say_about_giving_up/,2022-09-25 21:48:46,True
yahcxh,PonderinLife,askgaybros,Went to my first gay club: Update,"So here’s the update not a damn soul asked for. 

So, I took myself to a couple gay clubs in West Hollywood (Beaches and The Abbey). And here’s what I thought: 

1. I would hit on a dude who was married (or that’s what he told me). I went to the abbey. Saw this fine dude dancing with this girl. But there’s lot of guys dancing with girls, so I thought he was gay. So I take my ass up off the wall and go over them. I ask him “Are y’all together?“ and he’s like “I’m married.” Ow. I handled it pretty well. It did make me feel a little melancholic (if that’s the right word) ‘cause I feel like I’m attractive enough to have a partner. 

2. They carded me when I tried to get in. She asked to see my ID. And the guys like “How old are you?” And I’m like “24.” And then he’s like “You sure?” I hate looking young. This shit sucks man. I’m stuck constantly looking like a twink. And I would wear a hoodie with my outfit. But - in my defense - it’s an outfit that is very coordinated and looks very good. Giuseppe’s Zanotti’s. Biker jeans that emphasize my legs. But I’m kinda tired of looking young all the damn time. There’s like no benefit to it. 

3. Nobody knew how to dance. I mean, the beats were decent, but……..no one was dancing. I stood on the wall for a little bit, but after a while I wanted to go full out Tinashe. I was looking for someone to do a dance circle or something. Instead it was just LA gays with their female friends shimmying to the music. Even the strippers were stiff dancers. There was one old white man who was looking to cut loose. He was tryna move sumn. Even at Beaches it was just people bopping and getting stuff for their Instagram stories. 

4. The body’s were great though. Like, the shirtless male dancers they had in front of Beaches were, hot. It was also kinda interesting to see dudes in thongs and speedo’s in public. I’m gonna bulk for the winter and then cut before the summer. ‘Cause I’d love to have a body like that. But most of those guys are probably straight. But it did make me think that maybe I could strip if I ever got bored. 

5. A lot of straight people too. More than I thought. Which seemed so weird to have straight people go to a gay club with men shaking their asses in thongs. But it slaps made the whole thing feel a little more normal. 

6. I need friends. Like, badly. ‘Cause everyone was there with their friends. Like everyone had some sort of friend group. And I’m there by myself looking lost AF. Also, shout-out to JoJo from Beaches. He was pretty chill, only talked to him once. But he was nice. But Yeth, I need friends I can go out with. Otherwise I feel weird and find it even harder to socialize. 

7. I feel like I need to update my “going out wardrobe”. I felt so overdressed yet undressed at the same time. And I felt like my outfit was so outdated. I also felt too covered up. Like I should’ve showed more skin. I need to workout some more before I do that.

But every time at his place, at like 11:30 at night. I kept telling him, “I just wanna meet at a coffee shop in person. I’m looking to move a little slower.” He just went “Ok.” We both agree to meet and if we like each other we’d be FWB’s. He said he was fine with being FWB’s. So, we were both on the same page, or so I thought. He’d even sent me his home address like 4 times without me asking (as sign he was looking for quick sex I know). We agree to meet for coffee at 8 PM. 

So he sends me the name of the coffee shop we’re to meet up at. I get off work yesterday and something tells me to look up the address for the place before I leave the house. I look up the address and it shows that the place closes at 8. MF was going to send me to the place right as they close as a way to ghost and cancel on me. 

Jokes on him ‘cause I never left the house in the first place. I even sent him a message at 7:59 saying “You never planned to meet up did you?” A whole 45 minutes went by and no response.

xo5zmc,PonderinLife,askgaybros,Is it odd for a 40 year old to ghost AFTER agreeing to meet?,"Ok so, last night I (24, M, future top), was talking to this guy (40, M, bottom). He said he was 34, but he looked a little older in the 13 nudes he sent. He said my dick was fun sized. I asked him what he meant by that exactly, and explained the negative connotation to the phrase “fun sized”. He said “Fun size, for me meaning 7+ 😊☺️☺️🤩”. Lately I have been hearing from a lot of people that my dick is big, so I let it pass. But it did strike me as odd. 

We were talking about meeting up at his place. I disclosed that I was a virgin. 

He replied: Ok. I appreciate the share. I’d be honored to be your first when you’re ready. 

So, I ask him if he’s free Saturday night (last night). 

He says: Definitely not a late night kinda guy. I'm free before 11. Then sleepies 

I say: Lol. I get it. I could be over by 8, and then out before 10. 

He replies: I'd be down 

I say: Cool. I'll get ready. I'll bring the lube and the condoms. What's the address. 

Then radio silence. 30 minutes pass and nothing. It’s getting close to 8 PM and nothing no address. By 8:22, I was still full virgin. Which sucked because I had everything ready. I had the condom’s ready. I had the mine. I thought I had met a chill guy. We both talked about our love for Macaron’s and where to get the best ones in the area. The conversation was good. So I was disappointed to get ghosted by him. 

But I ended up getting deepthroated by a cute Spaniard who was 26. And it was a fun time. My height. Shaved head, tattoo’s, and a nipple piercing. He gagged on it, and thanked me afterward. Like dry heaving with the saliva strings once I pulled it out. Let me face fuck hum for a little bit, Slapped himself in the face with it. I just watched him enjoy himself after a little bit. It was fun seeing his cute face go to town. Then I did my business on his face. He was also very polite and straight forward.

xv552h,PonderinLife,askgaybros,How can I stop thinking about this guy I’ve never met?,"There’s a lot of different facets to the mental tailspin I’ve been in the last few days. So, let me begin. 

First off I (24, M) came across this guy (22, M) on Grindr. He’s like, *the* conventionally attractive guy in LA. 10/10. 6’2, yes he’s white. Kinda blonde? An incredible body! This dude is jacked man. He’s sparked my body dysmorphia. He’s hot and you can tell that he knows it. He has *that look* about him in every Instagram post where he gets 100’s of likes. They’re all thirst traps and photo’s of him with influencers of where he’s out on some boat. He has about 2.9K followers with hundreds of likes. Whereas my account is mainly Art/my music. I have about 9.6K followers (40.2K on TikTok for my singing/dancing), but not as many likes on my posts these days. 

So. I’ve been sending him my album on Grindr. Tapping his profile nightly. I followed him on IG, and I jumped in his DM’s once or twice. All attempts ignored. I know he probably has hundreds of guys jumping into his DM’s. He has such confidence. Plus I’m black and 5’6. And I know that I’m not as high up on the desirability totem pole because of those characteristics. And that’s also really fucking with me as well. Like, earlier today I was in a bad mood because I know I won’t be seen as attractive as him. Or that I’m not as attractive as him. Or that I won’t have guys jumping in my DM’s every second. Or that I won’t have to think “Is he with me just because of my looks?” You know, suffering from being drop dead gorgeous. 

The weird thing is, I’ve done modeling and was signed to an agent and everything. I have had random people tell me I look like a “model or an influencer.” I’ve posted in like every ratemeforum I could find and they were all like “8/10 surgery will do more harm than good.” Which is weird because I think I look ugly as hell. I hate my nose, wanna bleach my skin, etc. But compared to that guy? Nah. I can’t compare. I’d lose any competition with him. Makes me wanna get rid of these crappy African features. Like, why can’t I see what everyone else sees? 

Overall, I kinda wanna be him. If my face looked like his my life would be perfect. He seems to live a great life. Full of confidence and self assured ness. Could get anybody he wants. Is tall and drop dead gorgeous. Or at least seems to be extremely confident in himself. 

How do I deal with this? Like, how do I get over a guy I’ve never even met? I’ve been thinking about him more and lore and it’s kinda irritating.",0,0.17,0,/r/askgaybros/comments/xv552h/how_can_i_stop_thinking_about_this_guy_ive_never/,2022-10-03 21:18:11,True

I’m thinking if just jumping on roids. There’s this InstaGay I’ve been seeing on the gram and on Grindr and he has such a nice body. Like, it’s way nicer than mine.

So I (24, black, 5’6, top) had been talking to this guy (28, white, 6’4, bottom). So, we met up twice. Jacked off together once. He went out of town for a month to visit his parents. Came back and hit me with the “I’ve been thinking about what we are”. Pretty much said he wanted to be friends without the benefits or dating. I had no interest in that ‘cause I would be weird to be friends with someone after they’ve kissed your right asscheek. But I still said “Sure!” He replied with “So how have you been?” I blocked him and never responded. I had a few things in my life that were up in the air that I needed to focus on instead. Plus I felt being friends with him would be weird after he made it clear he didn’t wanna date. 

Until this morning. I got bored and figured I’d fuck around. So I unblocked his #. And said “Hey. What’s up?” Very dry. Very low effort. He responds with “Hey Ponder!  Was just thinking about you.” I know this isn’t true. Lol. 

If he was really thinking about me, he might have tried DMing me on Instagram (he has my IG as well). Or texting me. After all, you try to contact the guys you think about right? Not that I was sweating it. But it feels kinda fake to say “I was just thinking about you.” When we both know you really weren’t. He says he’s got 5 jobs and is really busy now.

Heavenly Father, I pray in Jesus name. 
Jesus looked at those who were wandering like sheep without a shepherd and said, “Ask the Lord of the harvest, to send out workers into his harvest field.” As you said, give Ha-young, Ye-yeong, Ui-seop, Jeong-won, Hye-ok, Yul-bin, Suzy, Eun-tae, In-sook, Im-hak enough workers for the harvest, and command them to gather the fruit we did not put in effort. 
- “I sent you to reap what you have not worked for.” John‬ ‭4‬:‭38‬ ‭NIV

Jesus, with your Holy Spirit, remove and cut off from us all evil spirits that oppose the truth, take away from their coat of scale armor on which they had depended, and distributes their plunder. And command true freedom from all the sins of our flesh.

Let the kingdom and righteousness of God be the sure possession of each of us. As you said, please make the result be true freedom, eternal life, everlasting peace, quietness and confidence.  - “The fruit of that righteousness will be peace; its effect will be quietness and confidence forever.”
‭‭Isaiah‬ ‭32‬:‭17‬ ‭

Rule our lives forever with the Spirit of Truth. And sustain us according to the verse of Psalm 27:4. 
- “I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and to seek him in his temple.”

yaviy6,ReasonableDuck9302,Christian,I struggle with OCD and need help and a friend to talk to :),"I struggle badly with ocd. It attacks my religion and it makes it very hard to be a Christian at times. It causes me so much stress I don’t know what to do. I truly love god and accept Jesus as my lord and my savior, yet I look at things out of fear of going to hell and always am worried if I’m sinning or not.

For some backstory, I had bad anxiety about death in November of 2020. It went away after a couple days, but came back badly in late December 2020. I decided to accept Jesus as my lord and my savior around that time and I had a fire for Jesus for a long time. Until some point in fall of 2021 I stopped reading the Bible and fell back into sin and would pray and try to stop but I would sin again and again. Thankfully I never gave up and continued believing and finally got my act together and I have been reading the Bible 30 mins a day and praying more often. Sometimes I pray multiple times a day!!! But when I read the Bible it triggers my ocd or even when I see anything about religion or death.

My intrusive thoughts try to get me to leave the religion and say awful things. So naturally I fight the thoughts. But then that actually causes ppl with ocd to panic and then have a panic attack. Fighting the thoughts is actually worse for you.

I’m not perfect, only God is perfect. God is so perfect that when he was in a human body Jesus was still PERFECT. 

Any advice on how to not listen to my intrusive thoughts? Because it’s getting to the point I have trouble reading the Bible. Religion should bring me joy not pain. So any advice on to ignore my thoughts? Because when I ignore them I worry if I left the faith and I worry if I just do all this out of fear etc… How as a Christian can I look at these thoughts and know they aren’t true and remember that Jesus is the truth.

xqyfyb,jazlyyn,Christian,"I want to be right again with him but I am so exhausted, drained, and stressed out everyday.","It feels like I can never catch a break. I don’t expect a perfect life. I know life is bound to have bad days and experiences. However it feels like I can never feel quite at home. We lost our home a little over a year ago and had to stay with a family member for almost another year since it was very hard to find another place after that. It was the worst year of my life. I had no home anymore. I lost all of my friends. I felt alone.. I felt hurt because I had all F’s and for some time was unable to do my work. I was so behind and stressed. Then my mom lost her job and it took months for her to find a new one. Before we even became “homeless” , I never felt at home even with a home. My moms boyfriend was very abusive and always came home drink. Once he even peed outside the door and all over the steps. He would break things and hurt me. He was very abusive to her too. There was a point where she tried to get him out but he refused to and we had to do a whole process in order to get him out with authorities. In the time before he left he made my life miserable. He grabbed a knife on me and attempted to murder me.. he has been in jail since but I was in a way happy I left that town. I got to leave all of my memories behind. Now here I am. I moved into this apartment a few months ago and I have absolute horrible neighbors. They make my life a living nightmare- quite literally since I live here and have to deal with this every day. They blast music from the moment they wake up 10AM- 3 AM. That’s almost 24 hours. Even if they aren’t awake they keep it blasting. I’ve tried every thing but they are drug dealers and I’m terrified of them. They bang on my ceiling all day and I have multiple cracks in my ceiling. They have been very passive aggressive with me and absolutely hate me. They’ve trashed our door, and started blasting sex tapes and explosions noises on top of all the other music due to them being in a process of eviction and they aren’t happy about it. I was crying so much and so exhausted I started to throw up. My hearing is getting damaged and my ears ring all day. I keep my volume at 100 because it’s the only way it mostly tunes it out which I use with my headphones. They brought a gun once outside and I was terrified. They look at me as I walk by with this hateful look. I’m unable to do my homework again. After I begin doing so well. I finally raised my GPA close to a 3.7 , I got 100 in most of my classes for 4 months, and since school started I’ve maintained all A’s for the past 2 months. But now I’m slaking again. Now that they do this all day and even night I don’t have time anymore. I can never focus anymore. I feel exhausted. I feel tired. I grew up with drug dealers and thought I finally moved onto better. It’s actually a nice neighborhood their the only issue. Multiple people have complained about them and they’ve harassed other neighbors. I’m afraid.. I’m scared.. and I’m hurt. I’m hurt because I’m tired of being hurt and under stress. I never got to enjoy my child hood, or even my teen years now. I don’t want to go home with people threatening me with guns, I don’t want to go home to sex tapes and music blasting almost 24 hours everyday. I’m not angry at God. Maybe I’m confused on why me again. I’m jealous of my friends who get to go home and sleep properly and don’t have to sleep in a car just to escape people like them.",9,0.92,0,/r/Christian/comments/xqyfyb/i_want_to_be_right_again_with_him_but_i_am_so/,2022-09-28 21:40:12,True

At least that’s been my goal for high school. Yesterday I was getting ready to do a test as I do online school and take these from home. We have to verify our face by showing the proctor. I did my face scan, entire room scan (which we have to do a 360 of) then it requested a photo Id. This test locked the night of and I was confused on why it asked for a photo ID because none of my other classes request this. This was also a last minute notice, as quarter one ended the next day. I happened to be out of town and couldn’t get a photo ID. I don’t have a license yet, a passport, or anything. She told me there’s nothing she could do about it and wanted to leave it on there. I tried every thing I could I even spoke to the school and they all did nothing. My grade went from a A to a D for a test I wasn’t able to access simply because she wanted to add a photo Id requirement when none of my other teachers found it necessary at all just her. She did this last minute to where I didn’t have enough time to obtain one and on such short notice. I honestly just want to drop out.

y1vb5d,jazlyyn,FacebookMarketplace,most awkward thing I’ve encountered in a while 😭,"I was selling something and I gotten a lot of interest, this was person asked for the address and once I gave it to them they never responded. I get this a lot so just move on. This person hasn’t answered in almost 14 hours, so it was safe to assume they weren’t coming. Someone else was interested and said they can send the money for the item to hold it but that their husband is sick so can’t get it today. So obviously I went with them, they seemed like a good buyer that wouldn’t be hard to deal with. I was relaxing until I heard loud knocking and locked out and seen two people standing. I then look on marketplace to see the people from 14 hours ago saying their here??? Like you don’t get to ask for my address, ignore me for 14 hours, then randomly pop up without even agreeing on a meet up time. It was SO awkward. I made up an excuse I wasn’t home since I didn’t know how they’d handle it and was hoping they would leave, they did. 😭how awkward.",5,1.0,0,/r/FacebookMarketplace/comments/y1vb5d/most_awkward_thing_ive_encountered_in_a_while/,2022-10-11 22:34:06,True
xzp8ec,jazlyyn,neighborsfromhell,Is there any immediate legal action that can be done?,"They are getting evicted but since their fighting it, it’s taking months.  I can’t live with these nut cases another day. These are full grown adults who have problem’s with me (a minior). I know the mother who lives upstairs has no job and her husbands works which gives her all day and night to be home. She hates me due to the eviction and has been purposely tormenting me. It has also been expressed that I have misophonia. She blasts music every single day and all night. I have kept a record of when it starts and ends and it can run from 19 hours, and the other 5 it’s typically turned off. Our doors have a very bad build which makes them loud when entering the house. Whenever I come home, it’s silent. After I set my bags down music starts blasting. This is a common routine that happens. It’s clear they are trying to keep music blasting nearly 24/7, with their poor sleep schedule the 5 hours it’s turned off it’s when they sleep. Then they have times where they blast it to 100% on a full on expensive boom box so you can imagine how that sounds. It’s so loud that I heard it all the way from my neighborhoods entrance when they blast it to 100. If I touch my tv (which the walls are thinner then some apartment builds so mumbles can be heard from my tv I’d assume, I don’t keep it loud) they will blast it to 100 and my neighbors complain about them and their neighbors, even other people who don’t even know them because everyone can hear it. I don’t watch tv at all anymore and just used my AirPods. My problem with this animosity that have between me is that it doesn’t only affect me but it affects my mother as well. She works from home because she suffers from illness that makes her unable to work in person and when they blast their music to 100 volume, loud enough for nearly a whole neighborhood to hear out of their hatered for me, it affects her too because she has to speak to customers all day over the phone and they hang up and report her if they hear too much background noise to the point they can’t even speak to her. If she gets too many of these she gets fired. I have school too. This has given me close to no time to do school work but a 5 hour period when they are sleeping and by that time I am exhausted. But more so, I really feel suicidal and I can’t live like this. I hear this nearly 24 hours , these people are psychotic and leave it on even when they aren’t home. I’ve had food thrown at my door, and I feel very harassed and think this is unacceptable. Is there anything I can do to have them out sooner? Maybe like file for harassment? I don’t know.. I’m lost for choices and I’m so drained. I expect this from college students out of anyone, but full grown not only adults, but parents?? doing this is beyond me. I’m more so upset this issue should of been handled before we even moved in! My Landlord knew how phycotic they were from the precious tenants and did nothing but tell other tenants who moved in newer apartments in to be happy they don’t live in my unit because they are extremely loud. Finally they did something after nearly half of our lease, and now by the time our lease ends they’ll be moved out. I shouldn’t have this much stress.

You could live for the instant gratification that you get from learning or spend your life trying to make sure that you are smart.
